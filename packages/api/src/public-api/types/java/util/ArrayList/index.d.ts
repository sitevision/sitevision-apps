/**
 * Resizable-array implementation of the <tt>List</tt> interface.  Implements
 *  all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including
 *  <tt>null</tt>.  In addition to implementing the <tt>List</tt> interface,
 *  this class provides methods to manipulate the size of the array that is
 *  used internally to store the list.  (This class is roughly equivalent to
 *  <tt>Vector</tt>, except that it is unsynchronized.)
 *
 *  <p>The <tt>size</tt>, <tt>isEmpty</tt>, <tt>get</tt>, <tt>set</tt>,
 *  <tt>iterator</tt>, and <tt>listIterator</tt> operations run in constant
 *  time.  The <tt>add</tt> operation runs in <i>amortized constant time</i>,
 *  that is, adding n elements requires O(n) time.  All of the other operations
 *  run in linear time (roughly speaking).  The constant factor is low compared
 *  to that for the <tt>LinkedList</tt> implementation.
 *
 *  <p>Each <tt>ArrayList</tt> instance has a <i>capacity</i>.  The capacity is
 *  the size of the array used to store the elements in the list.  It is always
 *  at least as large as the list size.  As elements are added to an ArrayList,
 *  its capacity grows automatically.  The details of the growth policy are not
 *  specified beyond the fact that adding an element has constant amortized
 *  time cost.
 *
 *  <p>An application can increase the capacity of an <tt>ArrayList</tt> instance
 *  before adding a large number of elements using the <tt>ensureCapacity</tt>
 *  operation.  This may reduce the amount of incremental reallocation.
 *
 *  <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 *  If multiple threads access an <tt>ArrayList</tt> instance concurrently,
 *  and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it
 *  <i>must</i> be synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is
 *  any operation that adds or deletes one or more elements, or explicitly
 *  resizes the backing array; merely setting the value of an element is not
 *  a structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by
 *  synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the list.
 *
 *  If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using the
 *  {@link Collections#synchronizedList Collections.synchronizedList}
 *  method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 *  unsynchronized access to the list:<pre>
 *    List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList(...));</pre>
 *
 *  <p><a name="fail-fast">
 *  The iterators returned by this class's {@link #iterator() iterator} and
 *  {@link #listIterator(int) listIterator} methods are <em>fail-fast</em>:</a>
 *  if the list is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is
 *  created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 *  {@link ListIterator#remove() remove} or
 *  {@link ListIterator#add(Object) add} methods, the iterator will throw a
 *  {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of
 *  concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather
 *  than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
 *  time in the future.
 *
 *  <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 *  as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 *  presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 *  throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException} on a best-effort basis.
 *  Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 *  exception for its correctness:  <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 *  should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
 *

 *  <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 *  Java Collections Framework</a>.
