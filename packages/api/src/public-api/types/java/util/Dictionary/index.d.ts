/**
 * The <code>Dictionary</code> class is the abstract parent of any
 *  class, such as <code>Hashtable</code>, which maps keys to values.
 *  Every key and every value is an object. In any one <tt>Dictionary</tt>
 *  object, every key is associated with at most one value. Given a
 *  <tt>Dictionary</tt> and a key, the associated element can be looked up.
 *  Any non-<code>null</code> object can be used as a key and as a value.
 *  <p>
 *  As a rule, the <code>equals</code> method should be used by
 *  implementations of this class to decide if two keys are the same.
 *  <p>
 *  <strong>NOTE: This class is obsolete.  New implementations should
 *  implement the Map interface, rather than extending this class.</strong>
