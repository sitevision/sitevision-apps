/**
 * A comparison function, which imposes a <i>total ordering</i> on some
 *  collection of objects.  Comparators can be passed to a sort method (such
 *  as {@link Collections#sort(List,Comparator) Collections.sort} or {@link
 *  Arrays#sort(Object[],Comparator) Arrays.sort}) to allow precise control
 *  over the sort order.  Comparators can also be used to control the order of
 *  certain data structures (such as {@link SortedSet sorted sets} or {@link
 *  SortedMap sorted maps}), or to provide an ordering for collections of
 *  objects that don't have a {@link Comparable natural ordering}.<p>
 *
 *  The ordering imposed by a comparator <tt>c</tt> on a set of elements
 *  <tt>S</tt> is said to be <i>consistent with equals</i> if and only if
 *  <tt>c.compare(e1, e2)==0</tt> has the same boolean value as
 *  <tt>e1.equals(e2)</tt> for every <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt> in
 *  <tt>S</tt>.<p>
 *
 *  Caution should be exercised when using a comparator capable of imposing an
 *  ordering inconsistent with equals to order a sorted set (or sorted map).
 *  Suppose a sorted set (or sorted map) with an explicit comparator <tt>c</tt>
 *  is used with elements (or keys) drawn from a set <tt>S</tt>.  If the
 *  ordering imposed by <tt>c</tt> on <tt>S</tt> is inconsistent with equals,
 *  the sorted set (or sorted map) will behave "strangely."  In particular the
 *  sorted set (or sorted map) will violate the general contract for set (or
 *  map), which is defined in terms of <tt>equals</tt>.<p>
 *
 *  For example, suppose one adds two elements {@code a} and {@code b} such that
 *  {@code (a.equals(b) && c.compare(a, b) != 0)}
 *  to an empty {@code TreeSet} with comparator {@code c}.
 *  The second {@code add} operation will return
 *  true (and the size of the tree set will increase) because {@code a} and
 *  {@code b} are not equivalent from the tree set's perspective, even though
 *  this is contrary to the specification of the
 *  {@link Set#add Set.add} method.<p>
 *
 *  Note: It is generally a good idea for comparators to also implement
 *  <tt>java.io.Serializable</tt>, as they may be used as ordering methods in
 *  serializable data structures (like {@link TreeSet}, {@link TreeMap}).  In
 *  order for the data structure to serialize successfully, the comparator (if
 *  provided) must implement <tt>Serializable</tt>.<p>
 *
 *  For the mathematically inclined, the <i>relation</i> that defines the
 *  <i>imposed ordering</i> that a given comparator <tt>c</tt> imposes on a
 *  given set of objects <tt>S</tt> is:<pre>
 *        {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) &lt;= 0}.
 *  </pre> The <i>quotient</i> for this total order is:<pre>
 *        {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) == 0}.
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  It follows immediately from the contract for <tt>compare</tt> that the
 *  quotient is an <i>equivalence relation</i> on <tt>S</tt>, and that the
 *  imposed ordering is a <i>total order</i> on <tt>S</tt>.  When we say that
 *  the ordering imposed by <tt>c</tt> on <tt>S</tt> is <i>consistent with
 *  equals</i>, we mean that the quotient for the ordering is the equivalence
 *  relation defined by the objects' {@link Object#equals(Object)
 *  equals(Object)} method(s):<pre>
 *      {(x, y) such that x.equals(y)}. </pre>
 *
 *  <p>Unlike {@code Comparable}, a comparator may optionally permit
 *  comparison of null arguments, while maintaining the requirements for
 *  an equivalence relation.

   *
   *  The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
