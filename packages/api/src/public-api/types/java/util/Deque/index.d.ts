/**
 * A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at
 *  both ends.  The name <i>deque</i> is short for "double ended queue"
 *  and is usually pronounced "deck".  Most {@code Deque}
 *  implementations place no fixed limits on the number of elements
 *  they may contain, but this interface supports capacity-restricted
 *  deques as well as those with no fixed size limit.
 *
 *  <p>This interface defines methods to access the elements at both
 *  ends of the deque.  Methods are provided to insert, remove, and
 *  examine the element.  Each of these methods exists in two forms:
 *  one throws an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a
 *  special value (either {@code null} or {@code false}, depending on
 *  the operation).  The latter form of the insert operation is
 *  designed specifically for use with capacity-restricted
 *  {@code Deque} implementations; in most implementations, insert
 *  operations cannot fail.
 *
 *  <p>The twelve methods described above are summarized in the
 *  following table:
 *
 *  <table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1>
 *  <caption>Summary of Deque methods</caption>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td></td>
 *     <td ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN = 2> <b>First Element (Head)</b></td>
 *     <td ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN = 2> <b>Last Element (Tail)</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td></td>
 *     <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Throws exception</em></td>
 *     <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Special value</em></td>
 *     <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Throws exception</em></td>

 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td><b>Examine</b></td>
 *     <td>{@link Deque#getFirst getFirst()}</td>
 *     <td>{@link Deque#peekFirst peekFirst()}</td>

 *   </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 *  <p>This interface extends the {@link Queue} interface.  When a deque is
 *  used as a queue, FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior results.  Elements are
 *  added at the end of the deque and removed from the beginning.  The methods
 *  inherited from the {@code Queue} interface are precisely equivalent to
 *  {@code Deque} methods as indicated in the following table:
 *
 *  <table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1>
 *  <caption>Comparison of Queue and Deque methods</caption>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td ALIGN=CENTER> <b>{@code Queue} Method</b></td>
 *     <td ALIGN=CENTER> <b>Equivalent {@code Deque} Method</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>{@link java.util.Queue#add add(e)}</td>
 *     <td>{@link #addLast addLast(e)}</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>{@link java.util.Queue#offer offer(e)}</td>
 *     <td>{@link #offerLast offerLast(e)}</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>{@link java.util.Queue#remove remove()}</td>
 *     <td>{@link #removeFirst removeFirst()}</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>{@link java.util.Queue#poll poll()}</td>
 *     <td>{@link #pollFirst pollFirst()}</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>{@link java.util.Queue#element element()}</td>
 *     <td>{@link #getFirst getFirst()}</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>{@link java.util.Queue#peek peek()}</td>
 *     <td>{@link #peek peekFirst()}</td>
 *   </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 *  <p>Deques can also be used as LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) stacks.  This
 *  interface should be used in preference to the legacy {@link Stack} class.
 *  When a deque is used as a stack, elements are pushed and popped from the
 *  beginning of the deque.  Stack methods are precisely equivalent to
 *  {@code Deque} methods as indicated in the table below:
 *
 *  <table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1>
 *  <caption>Comparison of Stack and Deque methods</caption>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td ALIGN=CENTER> <b>Stack Method</b></td>
 *     <td ALIGN=CENTER> <b>Equivalent {@code Deque} Method</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>{@link #push push(e)}</td>
 *     <td>{@link #addFirst addFirst(e)}</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>{@link #pop pop()}</td>
 *     <td>{@link #removeFirst removeFirst()}</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>{@link #peek peek()}</td>
 *     <td>{@link #peekFirst peekFirst()}</td>
 *   </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 *  <p>Note that the {@link #peek peek} method works equally well when
 *  a deque is used as a queue or a stack; in either case, elements are
 *  drawn from the beginning of the deque.
 *
 *  <p>This interface provides two methods to remove interior
 *  elements, {@link #removeFirstOccurrence removeFirstOccurrence} and
 *  {@link #removeLastOccurrence removeLastOccurrence}.
 *
 *  <p>Unlike the {@link List} interface, this interface does not
 *  provide support for indexed access to elements.
 *
 *  <p>While {@code Deque} implementations are not strictly required
 *  to prohibit the insertion of null elements, they are strongly
 *  encouraged to do so.  Users of any {@code Deque} implementations
 *  that do allow null elements are strongly encouraged <i>not</i> to
 *  take advantage of the ability to insert nulls.  This is so because
 *  {@code null} is used as a special return value by various methods
 *  to indicated that the deque is empty.
 *
 *  <p>{@code Deque} implementations generally do not define
 *  element-based versions of the {@code equals} and {@code hashCode}
 *  methods, but instead inherit the identity-based versions from class
 *  {@code Object}.
