/**
 * This class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Any
 *  non-<code>null</code> object can be used as a key or as a value. <p>
 *
 *  To successfully store and retrieve objects from a hashtable, the
 *  objects used as keys must implement the <code>hashCode</code>
 *  method and the <code>equals</code> method. <p>
 *
 *  An instance of <code>Hashtable</code> has two parameters that affect its
 *  performance: <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  The
 *  <i>capacity</i> is the number of <i>buckets</i> in the hash table, and the
 *  <i>initial capacity</i> is simply the capacity at the time the hash table
 *  is created.  Note that the hash table is <i>open</i>: in the case of a "hash
 *  collision", a single bucket stores multiple entries, which must be searched
 *  sequentially.  The <i>load factor</i> is a measure of how full the hash
 *  table is allowed to get before its capacity is automatically increased.
 *  The initial capacity and load factor parameters are merely hints to
 *  the implementation.  The exact details as to when and whether the rehash
 *  method is invoked are implementation-dependent.<p>
 *
 *  Generally, the default load factor (.75) offers a good tradeoff between
 *  time and space costs.  Higher values decrease the space overhead but
 *  increase the time cost to look up an entry (which is reflected in most
 *  <tt>Hashtable</tt> operations, including <tt>get</tt> and <tt>put</tt>).<p>
 *
 *  The initial capacity controls a tradeoff between wasted space and the
 *  need for <code>rehash</code> operations, which are time-consuming.
 *  No <code>rehash</code> operations will <i>ever</i> occur if the initial
 *  capacity is greater than the maximum number of entries the
 *  <tt>Hashtable</tt> will contain divided by its load factor.  However,
 *  setting the initial capacity too high can waste space.<p>
 *
 *  If many entries are to be made into a <code>Hashtable</code>,
 *  creating it with a sufficiently large capacity may allow the
 *  entries to be inserted more efficiently than letting it perform
 *  automatic rehashing as needed to grow the table. <p>
 *
 *  This example creates a hashtable of numbers. It uses the names of
 *  the numbers as keys:
 *  <pre>   {@code
 *    Hashtable<String, Integer> numbers
 *      = new Hashtable<String, Integer>();
 *    numbers.put("one", 1);
 *    numbers.put("two", 2);
 *    numbers.put("three", 3);}</pre>
 *
 *  <p>To retrieve a number, use the following code:
 *  <pre>   {@code
 *    Integer n = numbers.get("two");
 *    if (n != null) {
 *      System.out.println("two = " + n);
 *    }}</pre>
 *
 *  <p>The iterators returned by the <tt>iterator</tt> method of the collections
 *  returned by all of this class's "collection view methods" are
 *  <em>fail-fast</em>: if the Hashtable is structurally modified at any time
 *  after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 *  <tt>remove</tt> method, the iterator will throw a {@link
 *  ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 *  modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
 *  arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.
 *  The Enumerations returned by Hashtable's keys and elements methods are
 *  <em>not</em> fail-fast.
 *
 *  <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 *  as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 *  presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 *  throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
 *  Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 *  exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 *  should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
 *
 *  <p>As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to
 *  implement the {@link Map} interface, making it a member of the
 *  <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 *
 *  Java Collections Framework</a>.  Unlike the new collection
 *  implementations, {@code Hashtable} is synchronized.  If a
 *  thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use
 *  {@link HashMap} in place of {@code Hashtable}.  If a thread-safe
 *  highly-concurrent implementation is desired, then it is recommended
 *  to use {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap} in place of
 *  {@code Hashtable}.
