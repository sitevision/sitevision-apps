/**
 * The {@code Properties} class represents a persistent set of
 *  properties. The {@code Properties} can be saved to a stream
 *  or loaded from a stream. Each key and its corresponding value in
 *  the property list is a string.
 *  <p>
 *  A property list can contain another property list as its
 *  "defaults"; this second property list is searched if
 *  the property key is not found in the original property list.
 *  <p>
 *  Because {@code Properties} inherits from {@code Hashtable}, the
 *  {@code put} and {@code putAll} methods can be applied to a
 *  {@code Properties} object.  Their use is strongly discouraged as they
 *  allow the caller to insert entries whose keys or values are not
 *  {@code Strings}.  The {@code setProperty} method should be used
 *  instead.  If the {@code store} or {@code save} method is called
 *  on a "compromised" {@code Properties} object that contains a
 *  non-{@code String} key or value, the call will fail. Similarly,
 *  the call to the {@code propertyNames} or {@code list} method
 *  will fail if it is called on a "compromised" {@code Properties}
 *  object that contains a non-{@code String} key.
 *
 *  <p>
 *  The {@link #load(java.io.Reader) load(Reader)} <tt>/</tt>
 *  {@link #store(java.io.Writer, java.lang.String) store(Writer, String)}
 *  methods load and store properties from and to a character based stream
 *  in a simple line-oriented format specified below.
 *
 *  The {@link #load(java.io.InputStream) load(InputStream)} <tt>/</tt>
 *  {@link #store(java.io.OutputStream, java.lang.String) store(OutputStream, String)}
 *  methods work the same way as the load(Reader)/store(Writer, String) pair, except
 *  the input/output stream is encoded in ISO 8859-1 character encoding.
 *  Characters that cannot be directly represented in this encoding can be written using
 *  Unicode escapes as defined in section 3.3 of
 *  <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>;
 *  only a single 'u' character is allowed in an escape
 *  sequence. The native2ascii tool can be used to convert property files to and
 *  from other character encodings.
 *
 *  <p> The {@link #loadFromXML(InputStream)} and {@link
 *  #storeToXML(OutputStream, String, String)} methods load and store properties
 *  in a simple XML format.  By default the UTF-8 character encoding is used,
 *  however a specific encoding may be specified if required. Implementations
 *  are required to support UTF-8 and UTF-16 and may support other encodings.
 *  An XML properties document has the following DOCTYPE declaration:
 *
 *  <pre>
 *  &lt;!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd"&gt;
 *  </pre>
 *  Note that the system URI (http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd) is
 *  <i>not</i> accessed when exporting or importing properties; it merely
 *  serves as a string to uniquely identify the DTD, which is:
 *  <pre>

  /**
   * Reads a property list (key and element pairs) from the input
   *  character stream in a simple line-oriented format.
   *  <p>
   *  Properties are processed in terms of lines. There are two
   *  kinds of line, <i>natural lines</i> and <i>logical lines</i>.
   *  A natural line is defined as a line of
   *  characters that is terminated either by a set of line terminator
   *  characters ({@code \n} or {@code \r} or {@code \r\n})
   *  or by the end of the stream. A natural line may be either a blank line,
   *  a comment line, or hold all or some of a key-element pair. A logical
   *  line holds all the data of a key-element pair, which may be spread
   *  out across several adjacent natural lines by escaping
   *  the line terminator sequence with a backslash character
   *  {@code \}.  Note that a comment line cannot be extended
   *  in this manner; every natural line that is a comment must have
   *  its own comment indicator, as described below. Lines are read from
   *  input until the end of the stream is reached.
   *
   *  <p>
   *  A natural line that contains only white space characters is
   *  considered blank and is ignored.  A comment line has an ASCII
   *  {@code '#'} or {@code '!'} as its first non-white
   *  space character; comment lines are also ignored and do not
   *  encode key-element information.  In addition to line
   *  terminators, this format considers the characters space
   *  ({@code ' '}, {@code '\u0020'}), tab
   *  ({@code '\t'}, {@code '\u0009'}), and form feed
   *  ({@code '\f'}, {@code '\u000C'}) to be white
   *  space.
   *
   *  <p>
   *  If a logical line is spread across several natural lines, the
   *  backslash escaping the line terminator sequence, the line
   *  terminator sequence, and any white space at the start of the
   *  following line have no affect on the key or element values.
   *  The remainder of the discussion of key and element parsing
   *  (when loading) will assume all the characters constituting
   *  the key and element appear on a single natural line after
   *  line continuation characters have been removed.  Note that
   *  it is <i>not</i> sufficient to only examine the character
   *  preceding a line terminator sequence to decide if the line
   *  terminator is escaped; there must be an odd number of
   *  contiguous backslashes for the line terminator to be escaped.
   *  Since the input is processed from left to right, a
   *  non-zero even number of 2<i>n</i> contiguous backslashes
   *  before a line terminator (or elsewhere) encodes <i>n</i>
   *  backslashes after escape processing.
   *
   *  <p>
   *  The key contains all of the characters in the line starting
   *  with the first non-white space character and up to, but not
   *  including, the first unescaped {@code '='},
   *  {@code ':'}, or white space character other than a line
   *  terminator. All of these key termination characters may be
   *  included in the key by escaping them with a preceding backslash
   *  character; for example,<p>
   *
   *  {@code \:\=}<p>
   *
   *  would be the two-character key {@code ":="}.  Line
   *  terminator characters can be included using {@code \r} and
   *  {@code \n} escape sequences.  Any white space after the
   *  key is skipped; if the first non-white space character after
   *  the key is {@code '='} or {@code ':'}, then it is
   *  ignored and any white space characters after it are also
   *  skipped.  All remaining characters on the line become part of
   *  the associated element string; if there are no remaining
   *  characters, the element is the empty string
   *  {@code ""}.  Once the raw character sequences
   *  constituting the key and element are identified, escape
   *  processing is performed as described above.
   *
   *  <p>
   *  As an example, each of the following three lines specifies the key
   *  {@code "Truth"} and the associated element value
   *  {@code "Beauty"}:
   *  <pre>
   *  Truth = Beauty
   *   Truth:Beauty
   *  Truth                    :Beauty
   *  </pre>
   *  As another example, the following three lines specify a single
   *  property:
   *  <pre>
   *  fruits                           apple, banana, pear, \
   *                                   cantaloupe, watermelon, \
   *                                   kiwi, mango
   *  </pre>
   *  The key is {@code "fruits"} and the associated element is:
   *  <pre>"apple, banana, pear, cantaloupe, watermelon, kiwi, mango"</pre>
   *  Note that a space appears before each {@code \} so that a space
   *  will appear after each comma in the final result; the {@code \},
   *  line terminator, and leading white space on the continuation line are
   *  merely discarded and are <i>not</i> replaced by one or more other
   *  characters.
   *  <p>
   *  As a third example, the line:
   *  <pre>cheeses
   *  </pre>
   *  specifies that the key is {@code "cheeses"} and the associated
   *  element is the empty string {@code ""}.
   *  <p>
   *  <a name="unicodeescapes"></a>
   *  Characters in keys and elements can be represented in escape
   *  sequences similar to those used for character and string literals
   *  (see sections 3.3 and 3.10.6 of
   *  <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>).
   *
   *  The differences from the character escape sequences and Unicode
   *  escapes used for characters and strings are:
   *
   *  <ul>
   *  <li> Octal escapes are not recognized.
   *
   *  <li> The character sequence {@code \b} does <i>not</i>
   *  represent a backspace character.
   *
   *  <li> The method does not treat a backslash character,
   *  {@code \}, before a non-valid escape character as an
   *  error; the backslash is silently dropped.  For example, in a
   *  Java string the sequence {@code "\z"} would cause a
   *  compile time error.  In contrast, this method silently drops
   *  the backslash.  Therefore, this method treats the two character
   *  sequence {@code "\b"} as equivalent to the single
   *  character {@code 'b'}.
   *
   *  <li> Escapes are not necessary for single and double quotes;
   *  however, by the rule above, single and double quote characters
   *  preceded by a backslash still yield single and double quote
   *  characters, respectively.
   *
   *  <li> Only a single 'u' character is allowed in a Unicode escape
   *  sequence.
   *
   *  </ul>
   *  <p>
   *  The specified stream remains open after this method returns.
   * @param reader the input character stream.
   * @throws IOException if an error occurred when reading from the&#xA; input stream.
