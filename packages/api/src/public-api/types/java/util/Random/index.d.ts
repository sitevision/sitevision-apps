/**
 * An instance of this class is used to generate a stream of
 *  pseudorandom numbers. The class uses a 48-bit seed, which is
 *  modified using a linear congruential formula. (See Donald Knuth,
 *  <i>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2</i>, Section 3.2.1.)
 *  <p>
 *  If two instances of {@code Random} are created with the same
 *  seed, and the same sequence of method calls is made for each, they
 *  will generate and return identical sequences of numbers. In order to
 *  guarantee this property, particular algorithms are specified for the
 *  class {@code Random}. Java implementations must use all the algorithms
 *  shown here for the class {@code Random}, for the sake of absolute
 *  portability of Java code. However, subclasses of class {@code Random}
 *  are permitted to use other algorithms, so long as they adhere to the
 *  general contracts for all the methods.
 *  <p>
 *  The algorithms implemented by class {@code Random} use a
 *  {@code protected} utility method that on each invocation can supply
 *  up to 32 pseudorandomly generated bits.
 *  <p>
 *  Many applications will find the method {@link Math#random} simpler to use.
 *
 *  <p>Instances of {@code java.util.Random} are threadsafe.
 *  However, the concurrent use of the same {@code java.util.Random}
 *  instance across threads may encounter contention and consequent
 *  poor performance. Consider instead using
 *  {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom} in multithreaded
 *  designs.
 *
 *  <p>Instances of {@code java.util.Random} are not cryptographically
 *  secure.  Consider instead using {@link java.security.SecureRandom} to
 *  get a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator for use
 *  by security-sensitive applications.
