/**
 * A <code>Locale</code> object represents a specific geographical, political,
 *  or cultural region. An operation that requires a <code>Locale</code> to perform
 *  its task is called <em>locale-sensitive</em> and uses the <code>Locale</code>
 *  to tailor information for the user. For example, displaying a number
 *  is a locale-sensitive operation&mdash; the number should be formatted
 *  according to the customs and conventions of the user's native country,
 *  region, or culture.
 *
 *  <p> The {@code Locale} class implements IETF BCP 47 which is composed of
 *  <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647">RFC 4647 "Matching of Language
 *  Tags"</a> and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646">RFC 5646 "Tags
 *  for Identifying Languages"</a> with support for the LDML (UTS#35, "Unicode
 *  Locale Data Markup Language") BCP 47-compatible extensions for locale data
 *  exchange.
 *
 *  <p> A <code>Locale</code> object logically consists of the fields
 *  described below.
 *
 *  <dl>
 *    <dt><a name="def_language"><b>language</b></a></dt>
 *
 *    <dd>ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, or registered
 *    language subtags up to 8 alpha letters (for future enhancements).
 *    When a language has both an alpha-2 code and an alpha-3 code, the
 *    alpha-2 code must be used.  You can find a full list of valid
 *    language codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for
 *    "Type: language").  The language field is case insensitive, but
 *    <code>Locale</code> always canonicalizes to lower case.</dd>
 *
 *    <dd>Well-formed language values have the form
 *    <code>[a-zA-Z]{2,8}</code>.  Note that this is not the the full
 *    BCP47 language production, since it excludes extlang.  They are
 *    not needed since modern three-letter language codes replace
 *    them.</dd>

 *    for "Type: script").  The script field is case insensitive, but
 *    <code>Locale</code> always canonicalizes to title case (the first
 *    letter is upper case and the rest of the letters are lower
 *    case).</dd>
 *
 *    <dd>Well-formed script values have the form
 *    <code>[a-zA-Z]{4}</code></dd>

 *
 *    <dt><a name="def_region"><b>country (region)</b></a></dt>

 *    You can find a full list of valid country and region codes in the
 *    IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: region").  The
 *    country (region) field is case insensitive, but
 *    <code>Locale</code> always canonicalizes to upper case.</dd>
 *
 *    <dd>Well-formed country/region values have
 *    the form <code>[a-zA-Z]{2} | [0-9]{3}</code></dd>
 *
 *    <dd>Example: "US" (United States), "FR" (France), "029"
 *    (Caribbean)</dd>
 *
 *    <dt><a name="def_variant"><b>variant</b></a></dt>
 *
 *    <dd>Any arbitrary value used to indicate a variation of a
 *    <code>Locale</code>.  Where there are two or more variant values
 *    each indicating its own semantics, these values should be ordered
 *    by importance, with most important first, separated by
 *    underscore('_').  The variant field is case sensitive.</dd>
 *
 *    <dd>Note: IETF BCP 47 places syntactic restrictions on variant
 *    subtags.  Also BCP 47 subtags are strictly used to indicate
 *    additional variations that define a language or its dialects that
 *    are not covered by any combinations of language, script and
 *    region subtags.  You can find a full list of valid variant codes
 *    in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: variant").
 *
 *    <p>However, the variant field in <code>Locale</code> has
 *    historically been used for any kind of variation, not just
 *    language variations.  For example, some supported variants
 *    available in Java SE Runtime Environments indicate alternative
 *    cultural behaviors such as calendar type or number script.  In
 *    BCP 47 this kind of information, which does not identify the
 *    language, is supported by extension subtags or private use
 *    subtags.</dd>
 *
 *    <dd>Well-formed variant values have the form <code>SUBTAG
 *    (('_'|'-') SUBTAG)*</code> where <code>SUBTAG =
 *    [0-9][0-9a-zA-Z]{3} | [0-9a-zA-Z]{5,8}</code>. (Note: BCP 47 only

 *    case insensitive, but <code>Locale</code> canonicalizes all
 *    extension keys and values to lower case. Note that extensions
 *    cannot have empty values.</dd>
 *
 *    <dd>Well-formed keys are single characters from the set

 *    <code>SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}</code> and for other keys
 *    <code>SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{2,8}</code> (that is, 'x' allows

 *  </dl>
 *
 *  <b>Note:</b> Although BCP 47 requires field values to be registered
 *  in the IANA Language Subtag Registry, the <code>Locale</code> class
 *  does not provide any validation features.  The <code>Builder</code>
 *  only checks if an individual field satisfies the syntactic
 *  requirement (is well-formed), but does not validate the value
 *  itself.  See {@link Builder} for details.
 *
 *  <h3><a name="def_locale_extension">Unicode locale/language extension</a></h3>
 *
 *  <p>UTS#35, "Unicode Locale Data Markup Language" defines optional
 *  attributes and keywords to override or refine the default behavior
 *  associated with a locale.  A keyword is represented by a pair of
 *  key and type.  For example, "nu-thai" indicates that Thai local
 *  digits (value:"thai") should be used for formatting numbers
 *  (key:"nu").
 *
 *  <p>The keywords are mapped to a BCP 47 extension value using the
 *  extension key 'u' ({@link #UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION}).  The above
 *  example, "nu-thai", becomes the extension "u-nu-thai".code
 *
 *  <p>Thus, when a <code>Locale</code> object contains Unicode locale
 *  attributes and keywords,
 *  <code>getExtension(UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION)</code> will return a
 *  String representing this information, for example, "nu-thai".  The
 *  <code>Locale</code> class also provides {@link
 *  #getUnicodeLocaleAttributes}, {@link #getUnicodeLocaleKeys}, and
 *  {@link #getUnicodeLocaleType} which allow you to access Unicode
 *  locale attributes and key/type pairs directly.  When represented as
 *  a string, the Unicode Locale Extension lists attributes
 *  alphabetically, followed by key/type sequences with keys listed
 *  alphabetically (the order of subtags comprising a key's type is
 *  fixed when the type is defined)
 *
 *  <p>A well-formed locale key has the form
 *  <code>[0-9a-zA-Z]{2}</code>.  A well-formed locale type has the
 *  form <code>"" | [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8} ('-' [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8})*</code> (it
 *  can be empty, or a series of subtags 3-8 alphanums in length).  A
 *  well-formed locale attribute has the form
 *  <code>[0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8}</code> (it is a single subtag with the same
 *  form as a locale type subtag).
 *
 *  <p>The Unicode locale extension specifies optional behavior in
 *  locale-sensitive services.  Although the LDML specification defines
 *  various keys and values, actual locale-sensitive service
 *  implementations in a Java Runtime Environment might not support any
 *  particular Unicode locale attributes or key/type pairs.
 *
 *  <h4>Creating a Locale</h4>
 *
 *  <p>There are several different ways to create a <code>Locale</code>
 *  object.
 *
 *  <h5>Builder</h5>
 *
 *  <p>Using {@link Builder} you can construct a <code>Locale</code> object
 *  that conforms to BCP 47 syntax.
 *
 *  <h5>Constructors</h5>
 *
 *  <p>The <code>Locale</code> class provides three constructors:
 *  <blockquote>
 *  <pre>
 *      {@link #Locale(String language)}
 *      {@link #Locale(String language, String country)}
 *      {@link #Locale(String language, String country, String variant)}
 *  </pre>
 *  </blockquote>
 *  These constructors allow you to create a <code>Locale</code> object
 *  with language, country and variant, but you cannot specify
 *  script or extensions.
 *
 *  <h5>Factory Methods</h5>
 *
 *  <p>The method {@link #forLanguageTag} creates a <code>Locale</code>
 *  object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag.
 *
 *  <h5>Locale Constants</h5>
 *
 *  <p>The <code>Locale</code> class provides a number of convenient constants
 *  that you can use to create <code>Locale</code> objects for commonly used
 *  locales. For example, the following creates a <code>Locale</code> object
 *  for the United States:
 *  <blockquote>
 *  <pre>
 *      Locale.US
 *  </pre>
 *  </blockquote>
 *
 *  <h4><a name="LocaleMatching">Locale Matching</a></h4>
 *
 *  <p>If an application or a system is internationalized and provides localized
 *  resources for multiple locales, it sometimes needs to find one or more
 *  locales (or language tags) which meet each user's specific preferences. Note
 *  that a term "language tag" is used interchangeably with "locale" in this
 *  locale matching documentation.
 *
 *  <p>In order to do matching a user's preferred locales to a set of language
 *  tags, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647">RFC 4647 Matching of
 *  Language Tags</a> defines two mechanisms: filtering and lookup.
 *  <em>Filtering</em> is used to get all matching locales, whereas
 *  <em>lookup</em> is to choose the best matching locale.
 *  Matching is done case-insensitively. These matching mechanisms are described
 *  in the following sections.
 *
 *  <p>A user's preference is called a <em>Language Priority List</em> and is
 *  expressed as a list of language ranges. There are syntactically two types of
 *  language ranges: basic and extended. See
 *  {@link Locale.LanguageRange Locale.LanguageRange} for details.
 *
 *  <h5>Filtering</h5>
 *
 *  <p>The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
 *  in RFC 4647 as follows:
 *  "In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
 *  tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
 *  acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
 *  have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
 *  non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
 *  matching language tags."
 *
 *  <p>There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
 *  (called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
 *  (called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
 *  kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.
 *  {@link Locale.FilteringMode} is a parameter to specify how filtering should
 *  be done.
 *
 *  <h5>Lookup</h5>
 *
 *  <p>The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
 *  defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
 *  "By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
 *  specific tag that is an acceptable match.  The first matching tag found,
 *  according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
 *  item returned."
 *
 *  <p>For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,
 *  {@code "zh-Hant-TW"} and {@code "en-US"}, in prioritized order, lookup
 *  method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
 *  best matching language tag.
 *  <blockquote>
 *  <pre>
 *     1. zh-Hant-TW
 *     2. zh-Hant
 *     3. zh
 *     4. en-US
 *     5. en
 *  </pre>
 *  </blockquote>
 *  If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
 *  above, the language tag is returned.
 *
 *  <p>{@code "*"} is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.
 *
 *  <p>If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag {@code '*'}
 *  included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
 *  an {@link Iterator} over a {@link Collection} of language tags is treated as
 *  the best matching one.
 *
 *  <h4>Use of Locale</h4>
 *
 *  <p>Once you've created a <code>Locale</code> you can query it for information
 *  about itself. Use <code>getCountry</code> to get the country (or region)
 *  code and <code>getLanguage</code> to get the language code.
 *  You can use <code>getDisplayCountry</code> to get the
 *  name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
 *  you can use <code>getDisplayLanguage</code> to get the name of
 *  the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
 *  the <code>getDisplayXXX</code> methods are themselves locale-sensitive
 *  and have two versions: one that uses the default
 *  {@link Locale.Category#DISPLAY DISPLAY} locale and one
 *  that uses the locale specified as an argument.
 *
 *  <p>The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
 *  operations. For example, the <code>NumberFormat</code> class formats
 *  numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
 *  such as <code>NumberFormat</code> have several convenience methods
 *  for creating a default object of that type. For example, the
 *  <code>NumberFormat</code> class provides these three convenience methods
 *  for creating a default <code>NumberFormat</code> object:
 *  <blockquote>
 *  <pre>
 *      NumberFormat.getInstance()
 *      NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
 *      NumberFormat.getPercentInstance()
 *  </pre>
 *  </blockquote>
 *  Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
 *  and one without; the latter uses the default
 *  {@link Locale.Category#FORMAT FORMAT} locale:
 *  <blockquote>
 *  <pre>
 *      NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale)
 *      NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale)
 *      NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale)
 *  </pre>
 *  </blockquote>
 *  A <code>Locale</code> is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
 *  (<code>NumberFormat</code>) that you would like to get. The locale is
 *  <STRONG>just</STRONG> a mechanism for identifying objects,
 *  <STRONG>not</STRONG> a container for the objects themselves.
 *
 *  <h4>Compatibility</h4>
 *
 *  <p>In order to maintain compatibility with existing usage, Locale's
 *  constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
 *  Environment version 1.7.  The same is largely true for the
 *  <code>toString</code> method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
 *  be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
 *  of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
 *  to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
 *  variant field will have additional information in it if script or
 *  extensions are present.
 *
 *  <p>In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
 *  imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
 *  between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
 *  losing information. Thus <code>toLanguageTag</code> cannot
 *  represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
 *  do not conform to BCP 47.
 *
 *  <p>Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
 *  away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the
 *  <code>forLanguageTag</code> and <code>Locale.Builder</code> APIs instead.
 *  Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
 *  then always rely on <code>toLanguageTag</code> for this purpose.
 *
 *  <h5><a name="special_cases_constructor">Special cases</a></h5>
 *
 *  <p>For compatibility reasons, two
 *  non-conforming locales are treated as special cases.  These are
 *  <b><tt>ja_JP_JP</tt></b> and <b><tt>th_TH_TH</tt></b>. These are ill-formed
 *  in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
 *  these are treated specially during construction.  These two cases (and only
 *  these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
 *  exactly as they did prior to Java 7.
 *
 *  <p>Java has used <tt>ja_JP_JP</tt> to represent Japanese as used in
 *  Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
 *  representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
 *  Unicode locale key <tt>ca</tt> (for "calendar") and type
 *  <tt>japanese</tt>. When the Locale constructor is called with the
 *  arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
 *  automatically added.
 *
 *  <p>Java has used <tt>th_TH_TH</tt> to represent Thai as used in
 *  Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
 *  a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key
 *  <tt>nu</tt> (for "number") and value <tt>thai</tt>. When the Locale
 *  constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
 *  extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.
 *
 *  <h5>Serialization</h5>
 *
 *  <p>During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
 *  stream, including extensions.
 *
 *  <p>During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
 *  in <a href="#special_cases_constructor">Special Cases</a>, only
 *  for the two cases th_TH_TH and ja_JP_JP.
 *
 *  <h5>Legacy language codes</h5>
 *
 *  <p>Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
 *  their earlier, obsoleted forms: <tt>he</tt> maps to <tt>iw</tt>,
 *  <tt>yi</tt> maps to <tt>ji</tt>, and <tt>id</tt> maps to
 *  <tt>in</tt>.  This continues to be the case, in order to not break
 *  backwards compatibility.
 *
 *  <p>The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
 *  maintaining the old codes internal to Locale (so that
 *  <code>getLanguage</code> and <code>toString</code> reflect the old
 *  code), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
 *  that <code>toLanguageTag</code> reflects the new one). This
 *  preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
 *  API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
 *  lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
 *  can be named using either convention, see {@link ResourceBundle.Control}.
 *
 *  <h5>Three-letter language/country(region) codes</h5>
 *
 *  <p>The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
 *  and the country param be two characters in length, although in
 *  practice they have accepted any length.  The specification has now
 *  been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
 *  country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
 *  particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
 *  codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.  For
 *  compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
 *  constraint.

     *  the empty string, even if the variant, script, or extensions field is present (you
     *  can't have a locale with just a variant, the variant must accompany a well-formed
     *  language or country code).
     *
     *  <p>If script or extensions are present and variant is missing, no underscore is
     *  added before the "#".

     *  <p>This behavior is designed to support debugging and to be compatible with

     * Returns a well-formed IETF BCP 47 language tag representing
     *  this locale.
     *
     *  <p>If this <code>Locale</code> has a language, country, or
     *  variant that does not satisfy the IETF BCP 47 language tag
     *  syntax requirements, this method handles these fields as
     *  described below:
     *
     *  <p><b>Language:</b> If language is empty, or not <a
     *  href="#def_language" >well-formed</a> (for example "a" or
     *  "e2"), it will be emitted as "und" (Undetermined).
     *
     *  <p><b>Country:</b> If country is not <a
     *  href="#def_region">well-formed</a> (for example "12" or "USA"),
     *  it will be omitted.
     *
     *  <p><b>Variant:</b> If variant <b>is</b> <a
     *  href="#def_variant">well-formed</a>, each sub-segment
     *  (delimited by '-' or '_') is emitted as a subtag.  Otherwise:
     *  <ul>
     *
     *  <li>if all sub-segments match <code>[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}</code>
     *  (for example "WIN" or "Oracle_JDK_Standard_Edition"), the first
     *  ill-formed sub-segment and all following will be appended to
     *  the private use subtag.  The first appended subtag will be
     *  "lvariant", followed by the sub-segments in order, separated by
     *  hyphen. For example, "x-lvariant-WIN",
     *  "Oracle-x-lvariant-JDK-Standard-Edition".
     *
     *  <li>if any sub-segment does not match
     *  <code>[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}</code>, the variant will be truncated
     *  and the problematic sub-segment and all following sub-segments
     *  will be omitted.  If the remainder is non-empty, it will be
     *  emitted as a private use subtag as above (even if the remainder
     *  turns out to be well-formed).  For example,
     *  "Solaris_isjustthecoolestthing" is emitted as
     *  "x-lvariant-Solaris", not as "solaris".</li></ul>
     *
     *  <p><b>Special Conversions:</b> Java supports some old locale
     *  representations, including deprecated ISO language codes,
     *  for compatibility. This method performs the following
     *  conversions:
     *  <ul>
     *
     *  <li>Deprecated ISO language codes "iw", "ji", and "in" are
     *  converted to "he", "yi", and "id", respectively.
     *
     *  <li>A locale with language "no", country "NO", and variant
     *  "NY", representing Norwegian Nynorsk (Norway), is converted
     *  to a language tag "nn-NO".</li></ul>
     *
     *  <p><b>Note:</b> Although the language tag created by this
     *  method is well-formed (satisfies the syntax requirements
     *  defined by the IETF BCP 47 specification), it is not
     *  necessarily a valid BCP 47 language tag.  For example,
     *  <pre>
     *    new Locale("xx", "YY").toLanguageTag();</pre>
     *
     *  will return "xx-YY", but the language subtag "xx" and the
     *  region subtag "YY" are invalid because they are not registered
     *  in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.
