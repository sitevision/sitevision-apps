/**
 * A state object for collecting statistics such as count, min, max, sum, and
 *  average.
 *
 *  <p>This class is designed to work with (though does not require)
 *  {@linkplain java.util.stream streams}. For example, you can compute
 *  summary statistics on a stream of doubles with:
 *  <pre> {@code
 *  DoubleSummaryStatistics stats = doubleStream.collect(DoubleSummaryStatistics::new,
 *                                                       DoubleSummaryStatistics::accept,
 *                                                       DoubleSummaryStatistics::combine);
 *  }</pre>
 *
 *  <p>{@code DoubleSummaryStatistics} can be used as a
 *  {@linkplain java.util.stream.Stream#collect(Collector) reduction}
 *  target for a {@linkplain java.util.stream.Stream stream}. For example:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 *  DoubleSummaryStatistics stats = people.stream()
 *      .collect(Collectors.summarizingDouble(Person::getWeight));
 * }</pre>
 *
 *  This computes, in a single pass, the count of people, as well as the minimum,
 *  maximum, sum, and average of their weights.
 * @implNote This implementation is not thread safe. However, it is safe to use&#xA; {@link java.util.stream.Collectors#summarizingDouble(java.util.function.ToDoubleFunction)&#xA; Collectors.toDoubleStatistics()} on a parallel stream, because the parallel&#xA; implementation of {@link java.util.stream.Stream#collect Stream.collect()}&#xA; provides the necessary partitioning, isolation, and merging of results for&#xA; safe and efficient parallel execution.
 * @since 1.8
