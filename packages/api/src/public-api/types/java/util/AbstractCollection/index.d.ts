/**
 * This class provides a skeletal implementation of the <tt>Collection</tt>
 *  interface, to minimize the effort required to implement this interface. <p>
 *
 *  To implement an unmodifiable collection, the programmer needs only to
 *  extend this class and provide implementations for the <tt>iterator</tt> and
 *  <tt>size</tt> methods.  (The iterator returned by the <tt>iterator</tt>
 *  method must implement <tt>hasNext</tt> and <tt>next</tt>.)<p>
 *
 *  To implement a modifiable collection, the programmer must additionally
 *  override this class's <tt>add</tt> method (which otherwise throws an
 *  <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>), and the iterator returned by the
 *  <tt>iterator</tt> method must additionally implement its <tt>remove</tt>
 *  method.<p>
 *
 *  The programmer should generally provide a void (no argument) and
 *  <tt>Collection</tt> constructor, as per the recommendation in the
 *  <tt>Collection</tt> interface specification.<p>
 *
 *  The documentation for each non-abstract method in this class describes its
 *  implementation in detail.  Each of these methods may be overridden if
 *  the collection being implemented admits a more efficient implementation.<p>
 *
 *  This class is a member of the
 *  <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 *  Java Collections Framework</a>.
