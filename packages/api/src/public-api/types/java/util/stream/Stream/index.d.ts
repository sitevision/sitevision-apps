/**
 * A sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate
 *  operations.  The following example illustrates an aggregate operation using
 *  {@link Stream} and {@link IntStream}:
 *
 *  <pre>{@code
 *      int sum = widgets.stream()
 *                       .filter(w -> w.getColor() == RED)
 *                       .mapToInt(w -> w.getWeight())
 *                       .sum();
 *  }</pre>
 *
 *  In this example, {@code widgets} is a {@code Collection<Widget>}.  We create
 *  a stream of {@code Widget} objects via {@link Collection#stream Collection.stream()},
 *  filter it to produce a stream containing only the red widgets, and then
 *  transform it into a stream of {@code int} values representing the weight of
 *  each red widget. Then this stream is summed to produce a total weight.
 *
 *  <p>In addition to {@code Stream}, which is a stream of object references,
 *  there are primitive specializations for {@link IntStream}, {@link LongStream},
 *  and {@link DoubleStream}, all of which are referred to as "streams" and
 *  conform to the characteristics and restrictions described here.
 *
 *  <p>To perform a computation, stream
 *  <a href="package-summary.html#StreamOps">operations</a> are composed into a
 *  <em>stream pipeline</em>.  A stream pipeline consists of a source (which
 *  might be an array, a collection, a generator function, an I/O channel,
 *  etc), zero or more <em>intermediate operations</em> (which transform a
 *  stream into another stream, such as {@link Stream#filter(Predicate)}), and a
 *  <em>terminal operation</em> (which produces a result or side-effect, such
 *  as {@link Stream#count()} or {@link Stream#forEach(Consumer)}).
 *  Streams are lazy; computation on the source data is only performed when the
 *  terminal operation is initiated, and source elements are consumed only
 *  as needed.
 *
 *  <p>Collections and streams, while bearing some superficial similarities,
 *  have different goals.  Collections are primarily concerned with the efficient
 *  management of, and access to, their elements.  By contrast, streams do not
 *  provide a means to directly access or manipulate their elements, and are
 *  instead concerned with declaratively describing their source and the
 *  computational operations which will be performed in aggregate on that source.
 *  However, if the provided stream operations do not offer the desired
 *  functionality, the {@link #iterator()} and {@link #spliterator()} operations
 *  can be used to perform a controlled traversal.
 *
 *  <p>A stream pipeline, like the "widgets" example above, can be viewed as
 *  a <em>query</em> on the stream source.  Unless the source was explicitly
 *  designed for concurrent modification (such as a {@link ConcurrentHashMap}),
 *  unpredictable or erroneous behavior may result from modifying the stream
 *  source while it is being queried.
 *
 *  <p>Most stream operations accept parameters that describe user-specified
 *  behavior, such as the lambda expression {@code w -> w.getWeight()} passed to
 *  {@code mapToInt} in the example above.  To preserve correct behavior,
 *  these <em>behavioral parameters</em>:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>must be <a href="package-summary.html#NonInterference">non-interfering</a>
 *  (they do not modify the stream source); and</li>
 *  <li>in most cases must be <a href="package-summary.html#Statelessness">stateless</a>
 *  (their result should not depend on any state that might change during execution
 *  of the stream pipeline).</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p>Such parameters are always instances of a
 *  <a href="../function/package-summary.html">functional interface</a> such
 *  as {@link java.util.function.Function}, and are often lambda expressions or
 *  method references.  Unless otherwise specified these parameters must be
 *  <em>non-null</em>.
 *
 *  <p>A stream should be operated on (invoking an intermediate or terminal stream
 *  operation) only once.  This rules out, for example, "forked" streams, where
 *  the same source feeds two or more pipelines, or multiple traversals of the
 *  same stream.  A stream implementation may throw {@link IllegalStateException}
 *  if it detects that the stream is being reused. However, since some stream
 *  operations may return their receiver rather than a new stream object, it may
 *  not be possible to detect reuse in all cases.
 *
 *  <p>Streams have a {@link #close()} method and implement {@link AutoCloseable},
 *  but nearly all stream instances do not actually need to be closed after use.
 *  Generally, only streams whose source is an IO channel (such as those returned
 *  by {@link Files#lines(Path, Charset)}) will require closing.  Most streams
 *  are backed by collections, arrays, or generating functions, which require no
 *  special resource management.  (If a stream does require closing, it can be
 *  declared as a resource in a {@code try}-with-resources statement.)
 *
 *  <p>Stream pipelines may execute either sequentially or in
 *  <a href="package-summary.html#Parallelism">parallel</a>.  This
 *  execution mode is a property of the stream.  Streams are created
 *  with an initial choice of sequential or parallel execution.  (For example,
 *  {@link Collection#stream() Collection.stream()} creates a sequential stream,
 *  and {@link Collection#parallelStream() Collection.parallelStream()} creates
 *  a parallel one.)  This choice of execution mode may be modified by the
 *  {@link #sequential()} or {@link #parallel()} methods, and may be queried with
 *  the {@link #isParallel()} method.
