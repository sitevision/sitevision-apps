 * Base interface for streams, which are sequences of elements supporting
 *  sequential and parallel aggregate operations.  The following example
 *  illustrates an aggregate operation using the stream types {@link Stream}
 *  and {@link IntStream}, computing the sum of the weights of the red widgets:
 *
 *  <pre>{@code
 *      int sum = widgets.stream()
 *                       .filter(w -> w.getColor() == RED)

 *                       .sum();
 *  }</pre>
 *
 *  See the class documentation for {@link Stream} and the package documentation
 *  for <a href="package-summary.html">java.util.stream</a> for additional
 *  specification of streams, stream operations, stream pipelines, and
 *  parallelism, which governs the behavior of all stream types.
