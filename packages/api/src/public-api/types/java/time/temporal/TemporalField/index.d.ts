/**
 * A field of date-time, such as month-of-year or hour-of-minute.
 *  <p>
 *  Date and time is expressed using fields which partition the time-line into something
 *  meaningful for humans. Implementations of this interface represent those fields.
 *  <p>
 *  The most commonly used units are defined in {@link ChronoField}.
 *  Further fields are supplied in {@link IsoFields}, {@link WeekFields} and {@link JulianFields}.
 *  Fields can also be written by application code by implementing this interface.
 *  <p>
 *  The field works using double dispatch. Client code calls methods on a date-time like
 *  {@code LocalDateTime} which check if the field is a {@code ChronoField}.
 *  If it is, then the date-time must handle it.
 *  Otherwise, the method call is re-dispatched to the matching method in this interface.
 * @implSpec This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.&#xA; All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.&#xA; Implementations should be {@code Serializable} where possible.&#xA; An enum is as effective implementation choice.

   * @implSpec If an implementation represents a field that can be simplified, or&#xA; combined with others, then this method must be implemented.&#xA; <p>&#xA; The specified map contains the current state of the parse.&#xA; The map is mutable and must be mutated to resolve the field and&#xA; any related fields. This method will only be invoked during parsing&#xA; if the map contains this field, and implementations should therefore&#xA; assume this field is present.&#xA; <p>&#xA; Resolving a field will consist of looking at the value of this field,&#xA; and potentially other fields, and either updating the map with a&#xA; simpler value, such as a {@code ChronoField}, or returning a&#xA; complete {@code ChronoLocalDate}. If a resolve is successful,&#xA; the code must remove all the fields that were resolved from the map,&#xA; including this field.&#xA; <p>&#xA; For example, the {@code IsoFields} class contains the quarter-of-year&#xA; and day-of-quarter fields. The implementation of this method in that class&#xA; resolves the two fields plus the {@link ChronoField#YEAR YEAR} into a&#xA; complete {@code LocalDate}. The resolve method will remove all three&#xA; fields from the map before returning the {@code LocalDate}.&#xA; <p>&#xA; A partially complete temporal is used to allow the chronology and zone&#xA; to be queried. In general, only the chronology will be needed.&#xA; Querying items other than the zone or chronology is undefined and&#xA; must not be relied on.&#xA; The behavior of other methods such as {@code get}, {@code getLong},&#xA; {@code range} and {@code isSupported} is unpredictable and the results undefined.&#xA; <p>&#xA; If resolution should be possible, but the data is invalid, the resolver&#xA; style should be used to determine an appropriate level of leniency, which&#xA; may require throwing a {@code DateTimeException} or {@code ArithmeticException}.&#xA; If no resolution is possible, the resolve method must return null.&#xA; <p>&#xA; When resolving time fields, the map will be altered and null returned.&#xA; When resolving date fields, the date is normally returned from the method,&#xA; with the map altered to remove the resolved fields. However, it would also&#xA; be acceptable for the date fields to be resolved into other {@code ChronoField}&#xA; instances that can produce a date, such as {@code EPOCH_DAY}.&#xA; <p>&#xA; Not all {@code TemporalAccessor} implementations are accepted as return values.&#xA; Implementations that call this method must accept {@code ChronoLocalDate},&#xA; {@code ChronoLocalDateTime}, {@code ChronoZonedDateTime} and {@code LocalTime}.&#xA; <p>&#xA; The default implementation must return null.
