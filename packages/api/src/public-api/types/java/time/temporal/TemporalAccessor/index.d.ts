/**
 * Framework-level interface defining read-only access to a temporal object,
 *  such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.
 *  <p>
 *  This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects.
 *  It is implemented by those classes that can provide information
 *  as {@linkplain TemporalField fields} or {@linkplain TemporalQuery queries}.
 *  <p>
 *  Most date and time information can be represented as a number.
 *  These are modeled using {@code TemporalField} with the number held using
 *  a {@code long} to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month are
 *  simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.
 *  See {@link ChronoField} for the standard set of fields.
 *  <p>
 *  Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,
 *  the {@linkplain java.time.chrono.Chronology chronology} and the
 *  {@linkplain java.time.ZoneId time-zone}.
 *  These can be accessed via {@linkplain #query(TemporalQuery) queries} using
 *  the static methods defined on {@link TemporalQuery}.
 *  <p>
 *  A sub-interface, {@link Temporal}, extends this definition to one that also
 *  supports adjustment and manipulation on more complete temporal objects.
 *  <p>
 *  This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
 *  used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
 *  around instances of concrete types, such as {@code LocalDate}.
 *  There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations
 *  of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.
 *  See {@link java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate} for a fuller discussion of the issues.
 * @implSpec This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,&#xA; however immutability is strongly recommended.
 * @since 1.8
