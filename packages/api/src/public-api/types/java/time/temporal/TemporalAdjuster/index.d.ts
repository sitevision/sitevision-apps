/**
 * Strategy for adjusting a temporal object.
 *  <p>
 *  Adjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects.
 *  They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different
 *  approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.
 *  Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that
 *  sets the date to the last day of the month.
 *  <p>
 *  There are two equivalent ways of using a {@code TemporalAdjuster}.
 *  The first is to invoke the method on this interface directly.
 *  The second is to use {@link Temporal#with(TemporalAdjuster)}:
 *  <pre>
 *    // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
 *    temporal = thisAdjuster.adjustInto(temporal);
 *    temporal = temporal.with(thisAdjuster);
 *  </pre>
 *  It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code with(TemporalAdjuster)},
 *  as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
 *  <p>
 *  The {@link TemporalAdjusters} class contains a standard set of adjusters,
 *  available as static methods.
 *  These include:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>finding the first or last day of the month
 *  <li>finding the first day of next month
 *  <li>finding the first or last day of the year
 *  <li>finding the first day of next year
 *  <li>finding the first or last day-of-week within a month, such as "first Wednesday in June"
 *  <li>finding the next or previous day-of-week, such as "next Thursday"
 *  </ul>
 * @implSpec This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,&#xA; however immutability is strongly recommended.
 * @see TemporalAdjusters
 * @since 1.8
