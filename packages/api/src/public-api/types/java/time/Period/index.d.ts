/**
 * A date-based amount of time in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 *  such as '2 years, 3 months and 4 days'.
 *  <p>
 *  This class models a quantity or amount of time in terms of years, months and days.
 *  See {@link Duration} for the time-based equivalent to this class.
 *  <p>
 *  Durations and periods differ in their treatment of daylight savings time
 *  when added to {@link ZonedDateTime}. A {@code Duration} will add an exact
 *  number of seconds, thus a duration of one day is always exactly 24 hours.
 *  By contrast, a {@code Period} will add a conceptual day, trying to maintain
 *  the local time.
 *  <p>
 *  For example, consider adding a period of one day and a duration of one day to
 *  18:00 on the evening before a daylight savings gap. The {@code Period} will add
 *  the conceptual day and result in a {@code ZonedDateTime} at 18:00 the following day.
 *  By contrast, the {@code Duration} will add exactly 24 hours, resulting in a
 *  {@code ZonedDateTime} at 19:00 the following day (assuming a one hour DST gap).
 *  <p>
 *  The supported units of a period are {@link ChronoUnit#YEARS YEARS},
 *  {@link ChronoUnit#MONTHS MONTHS} and {@link ChronoUnit#DAYS DAYS}.
 *  All three fields are always present, but may be set to zero.
 *  <p>
 *  The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 *  in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
 *  system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 *  <p>
 *  The period is modeled as a directed amount of time, meaning that individual parts of the
 *  period may be negative.
 *
 *  <p>
 *  This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 *  class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 *  ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 *  {@code Period} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 *  The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 * @implSpec This class is immutable and thread-safe.
