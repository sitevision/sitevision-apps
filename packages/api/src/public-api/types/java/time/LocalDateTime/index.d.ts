/**
 * A date-time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 *  such as {@code 2007-12-03T10:15:30}.
 *  <p>
 *  {@code LocalDateTime} is an immutable date-time object that represents a date-time,
 *  often viewed as year-month-day-hour-minute-second. Other date and time fields,
 *  such as day-of-year, day-of-week and week-of-year, can also be accessed.
 *  Time is represented to nanosecond precision.
 *  For example, the value "2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789" can be
 *  stored in a {@code LocalDateTime}.
 *  <p>
 *  This class does not store or represent a time-zone.
 *  Instead, it is a description of the date, as used for birthdays, combined with
 *  the local time as seen on a wall clock.
 *  It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
 *  such as an offset or time-zone.
 *  <p>
 *  The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 *  in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
 *  system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 *  For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
 *  However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
 *  to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
 *
 *  <p>
 *  This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 *  class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 *  ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 *  {@code LocalDateTime} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 *  The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 * @implSpec This class is immutable and thread-safe.
