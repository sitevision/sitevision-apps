/**
 * An instantaneous point on the time-line.
 *  <p>
 *  This class models a single instantaneous point on the time-line.
 *  This might be used to record event time-stamps in the application.
 *  <p>
 *  The range of an instant requires the storage of a number larger than a {@code long}.
 *  To achieve this, the class stores a {@code long} representing epoch-seconds and an
 *  {@code int} representing nanosecond-of-second, which will always be between 0 and 999,999,999.
 *  The epoch-seconds are measured from the standard Java epoch of {@code 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z}
 *  where instants after the epoch have positive values, and earlier instants have negative values.
 *  For both the epoch-second and nanosecond parts, a larger value is always later on the time-line
 *  than a smaller value.
 *
 *  <h3>Time-scale</h3>
 *  <p>
 *  The length of the solar day is the standard way that humans measure time.
 *  This has traditionally been subdivided into 24 hours of 60 minutes of 60 seconds,
 *  forming a 86400 second day.
 *  <p>
 *  Modern timekeeping is based on atomic clocks which precisely define an SI second
 *  relative to the transitions of a Caesium atom. The length of an SI second was defined
 *  to be very close to the 86400th fraction of a day.
 *  <p>
 *  Unfortunately, as the Earth rotates the length of the day varies.
 *  In addition, over time the average length of the day is getting longer as the Earth slows.
 *  As a result, the length of a solar day in 2012 is slightly longer than 86400 SI seconds.
 *  The actual length of any given day and the amount by which the Earth is slowing
 *  are not predictable and can only be determined by measurement.
 *  The UT1 time-scale captures the accurate length of day, but is only available some
 *  time after the day has completed.
 *  <p>
 *  The UTC time-scale is a standard approach to bundle up all the additional fractions
 *  of a second from UT1 into whole seconds, known as <i>leap-seconds</i>.
 *  A leap-second may be added or removed depending on the Earth's rotational changes.
 *  As such, UTC permits a day to have 86399 SI seconds or 86401 SI seconds where
 *  necessary in order to keep the day aligned with the Sun.
 *  <p>
 *  The modern UTC time-scale was introduced in 1972, introducing the concept of whole leap-seconds.
 *  Between 1958 and 1972, the definition of UTC was complex, with minor sub-second leaps and
 *  alterations to the length of the notional second. As of 2012, discussions are underway
 *  to change the definition of UTC again, with the potential to remove leap seconds or
 *  introduce other changes.
 *  <p>
 *  Given the complexity of accurate timekeeping described above, this Java API defines
 *  its own time-scale, the <i>Java Time-Scale</i>.
 *  <p>
 *  The Java Time-Scale divides each calendar day into exactly 86400
 *  subdivisions, known as seconds.  These seconds may differ from the
 *  SI second.  It closely matches the de facto international civil time
 *  scale, the definition of which changes from time to time.
 *  <p>
 *  The Java Time-Scale has slightly different definitions for different
 *  segments of the time-line, each based on the consensus international
 *  time scale that is used as the basis for civil time. Whenever the
 *  internationally-agreed time scale is modified or replaced, a new
 *  segment of the Java Time-Scale must be defined for it.  Each segment
 *  must meet these requirements:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>the Java Time-Scale shall closely match the underlying international
 *   civil time scale;</li>
 *  <li>the Java Time-Scale shall exactly match the international civil
 *   time scale at noon each day;</li>
 *  <li>the Java Time-Scale shall have a precisely-defined relationship to
 *   the international civil time scale.</li>
 *  </ul>
 *  There are currently, as of 2013, two segments in the Java time-scale.
 *  <p>
 *  For the segment from 1972-11-03 (exact boundary discussed below) until
 *  further notice, the consensus international time scale is UTC (with
 *  leap seconds).  In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is identical to
 *  <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/utc-sls/">UTC-SLS</a>.
 *  This is identical to UTC on days that do not have a leap second.
 *  On days that do have a leap second, the leap second is spread equally
 *  over the last 1000 seconds of the day, maintaining the appearance of
 *  exactly 86400 seconds per day.
 *  <p>
 *  For the segment prior to 1972-11-03, extending back arbitrarily far,
 *  the consensus international time scale is defined to be UT1, applied
 *  proleptically, which is equivalent to the (mean) solar time on the
 *  prime meridian (Greenwich). In this segment, the Java Time-Scale is
 *  identical to the consensus international time scale. The exact
 *  boundary between the two segments is the instant where UT1 = UTC
 *  between 1972-11-03T00:00 and 1972-11-04T12:00.
 *  <p>
 *  Implementations of the Java time-scale using the JSR-310 API are not
 *  required to provide any clock that is sub-second accurate, or that
 *  progresses monotonically or smoothly. Implementations are therefore
 *  not required to actually perform the UTC-SLS slew or to otherwise be
 *  aware of leap seconds. JSR-310 does, however, require that
 *  implementations must document the approach they use when defining a
 *  clock representing the current instant.
 *  See {@link Clock} for details on the available clocks.
 *  <p>
 *  The Java time-scale is used for all date-time classes.
 *  This includes {@code Instant}, {@code LocalDate}, {@code LocalTime}, {@code OffsetDateTime},
 *  {@code ZonedDateTime} and {@code Duration}.
 *
 *  <p>
 *  This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 *  class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 *  ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 *  {@code Instant} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 *  The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 * @implSpec This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 * @since 1.8
