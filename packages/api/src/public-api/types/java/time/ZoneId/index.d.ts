/**
 * A time-zone ID, such as {@code Europe/Paris}.
 *  <p>
 *  A {@code ZoneId} is used to identify the rules used to convert between
 *  an {@link Instant} and a {@link LocalDateTime}.
 *  There are two distinct types of ID:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Fixed offsets - a fully resolved offset from UTC/Greenwich, that uses
 *   the same offset for all local date-times
 *  <li>Geographical regions - an area where a specific set of rules for finding
 *   the offset from UTC/Greenwich apply
 *  </ul>
 *  Most fixed offsets are represented by {@link ZoneOffset}.
 *  Calling {@link #normalized()} on any {@code ZoneId} will ensure that a
 *  fixed offset ID will be represented as a {@code ZoneOffset}.
 *  <p>
 *  The actual rules, describing when and how the offset changes, are defined by {@link ZoneRules}.
 *  This class is simply an ID used to obtain the underlying rules.
 *  This approach is taken because rules are defined by governments and change
 *  frequently, whereas the ID is stable.
 *  <p>
 *  The distinction has other effects. Serializing the {@code ZoneId} will only send
 *  the ID, whereas serializing the rules sends the entire data set.
 *  Similarly, a comparison of two IDs only examines the ID, whereas
 *  a comparison of two rules examines the entire data set.
 *
 *  <h3>Time-zone IDs</h3>
 *  The ID is unique within the system.
 *  There are three types of ID.
 *  <p>
 *  The simplest type of ID is that from {@code ZoneOffset}.
 *  This consists of 'Z' and IDs starting with '+' or '-'.
 *  <p>
 *  The next type of ID are offset-style IDs with some form of prefix,
 *  such as 'GMT+2' or 'UTC+01:00'.
 *  The recognised prefixes are 'UTC', 'GMT' and 'UT'.
 *  The offset is the suffix and will be normalized during creation.
 *  These IDs can be normalized to a {@code ZoneOffset} using {@code normalized()}.
 *  <p>
 *  The third type of ID are region-based IDs. A region-based ID must be of
 *  two or more characters, and not start with 'UTC', 'GMT', 'UT' '+' or '-'.
 *  Region-based IDs are defined by configuration, see {@link ZoneRulesProvider}.
 *  The configuration focuses on providing the lookup from the ID to the
 *  underlying {@code ZoneRules}.
 *  <p>
 *  Time-zone rules are defined by governments and change frequently.
 *  There are a number of organizations, known here as groups, that monitor
 *  time-zone changes and collate them.
 *  The default group is the IANA Time Zone Database (TZDB).
 *  Other organizations include IATA (the airline industry body) and Microsoft.
 *  <p>
 *  Each group defines its own format for the region ID it provides.
 *  The TZDB group defines IDs such as 'Europe/London' or 'America/New_York'.
 *  TZDB IDs take precedence over other groups.
 *  <p>
 *  It is strongly recommended that the group name is included in all IDs supplied by
 *  groups other than TZDB to avoid conflicts. For example, IATA airline time-zone
 *  region IDs are typically the same as the three letter airport code.
 *  However, the airport of Utrecht has the code 'UTC', which is obviously a conflict.
 *  The recommended format for region IDs from groups other than TZDB is 'group~region'.
 *  Thus if IATA data were defined, Utrecht airport would be 'IATA~UTC'.
 *
 *  <h3>Serialization</h3>
 *  This class can be serialized and stores the string zone ID in the external form.
 *  The {@code ZoneOffset} subclass uses a dedicated format that only stores the
 *  offset from UTC/Greenwich.
 *  <p>
 *  A {@code ZoneId} can be deserialized in a Java Runtime where the ID is unknown.
 *  For example, if a server-side Java Runtime has been updated with a new zone ID, but
 *  the client-side Java Runtime has not been updated. In this case, the {@code ZoneId}
 *  object will exist, and can be queried using {@code getId}, {@code equals},
 *  {@code hashCode}, {@code toString}, {@code getDisplayName} and {@code normalized}.
 *  However, any call to {@code getRules} will fail with {@code ZoneRulesException}.
 *  This approach is designed to allow a {@link ZonedDateTime} to be loaded and
 *  queried, but not modified, on a Java Runtime with incomplete time-zone information.
 *
 *  <p>
 *  This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 *  class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 *  ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 *  {@code ZoneId} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 *  The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 * @implSpec This abstract class has two implementations, both of which are immutable and thread-safe.&#xA; One implementation models region-based IDs, the other is {@code ZoneOffset} modelling&#xA; offset-based IDs. This difference is visible in serialization.
 * @since 1.8
