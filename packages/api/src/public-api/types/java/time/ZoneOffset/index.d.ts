/**
 * A time-zone offset from Greenwich/UTC, such as {@code +02:00}.
 *  <p>
 *  A time-zone offset is the amount of time that a time-zone differs from Greenwich/UTC.
 *  This is usually a fixed number of hours and minutes.
 *  <p>
 *  Different parts of the world have different time-zone offsets.
 *  The rules for how offsets vary by place and time of year are captured in the
 *  {@link ZoneId} class.
 *  <p>
 *  For example, Paris is one hour ahead of Greenwich/UTC in winter and two hours
 *  ahead in summer. The {@code ZoneId} instance for Paris will reference two
 *  {@code ZoneOffset} instances - a {@code +01:00} instance for winter,
 *  and a {@code +02:00} instance for summer.
 *  <p>
 *  In 2008, time-zone offsets around the world extended from -12:00 to +14:00.
 *  To prevent any problems with that range being extended, yet still provide
 *  validation, the range of offsets is restricted to -18:00 to 18:00 inclusive.
 *  <p>
 *  This class is designed for use with the ISO calendar system.
 *  The fields of hours, minutes and seconds make assumptions that are valid for the
 *  standard ISO definitions of those fields. This class may be used with other
 *  calendar systems providing the definition of the time fields matches those
 *  of the ISO calendar system.
 *  <p>
 *  Instances of {@code ZoneOffset} must be compared using {@link #equals}.
 *  Implementations may choose to cache certain common offsets, however
 *  applications must not rely on such caching.
 *
 *  <p>
 *  This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 *  class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 *  ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 *  {@code ZoneOffset} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 *  The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 * @implSpec This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 * @since 1.8
