/**
 * A date without time-of-day or time-zone in an arbitrary chronology, intended
 *  for advanced globalization use cases.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Most applications should declare method signatures, fields and variables
 *  as {@link LocalDate}, not this interface.</b>
 *  <p>
 *  A {@code ChronoLocalDate} is the abstract representation of a date where the
 *  {@code Chronology chronology}, or calendar system, is pluggable.
 *  The date is defined in terms of fields expressed by {@link TemporalField},
 *  where most common implementations are defined in {@link ChronoField}.
 *  The chronology defines how the calendar system operates and the meaning of
 *  the standard fields.
 *
 *  <h3>When to use this interface</h3>
 *  The design of the API encourages the use of {@code LocalDate} rather than this
 *  interface, even in the case where the application needs to deal with multiple
 *  calendar systems.
 *  <p>
 *  This concept can seem surprising at first, as the natural way to globalize an
 *  application might initially appear to be to abstract the calendar system.
 *  However, as explored below, abstracting the calendar system is usually the wrong
 *  approach, resulting in logic errors and hard to find bugs.
 *  As such, it should be considered an application-wide architectural decision to choose
 *  to use this interface as opposed to {@code LocalDate}.
 *
 *  <h3>Architectural issues to consider</h3>
 *  These are some of the points that must be considered before using this interface
 *  throughout an application.
 *  <p>
 *  1) Applications using this interface, as opposed to using just {@code LocalDate},
 *  face a significantly higher probability of bugs. This is because the calendar system
 *  in use is not known at development time. A key cause of bugs is where the developer
 *  applies assumptions from their day-to-day knowledge of the ISO calendar system
 *  to code that is intended to deal with any arbitrary calendar system.
 *  The section below outlines how those assumptions can cause problems
 *  The primary mechanism for reducing this increased risk of bugs is a strong code review process.
 *  This should also be considered a extra cost in maintenance for the lifetime of the code.
 *  <p>
 *  2) This interface does not enforce immutability of implementations.
 *  While the implementation notes indicate that all implementations must be immutable
 *  there is nothing in the code or type system to enforce this. Any method declared
 *  to accept a {@code ChronoLocalDate} could therefore be passed a poorly or
 *  maliciously written mutable implementation.
 *  <p>
 *  3) Applications using this interface  must consider the impact of eras.
 *  {@code LocalDate} shields users from the concept of eras, by ensuring that {@code getYear()}
 *  returns the proleptic year. That decision ensures that developers can think of
 *  {@code LocalDate} instances as consisting of three fields - year, month-of-year and day-of-month.
 *  By contrast, users of this interface must think of dates as consisting of four fields -
 *  era, year-of-era, month-of-year and day-of-month. The extra era field is frequently
 *  forgotten, yet it is of vital importance to dates in an arbitrary calendar system.
 *  For example, in the Japanese calendar system, the era represents the reign of an Emperor.
 *  Whenever one reign ends and another starts, the year-of-era is reset to one.
 *  <p>
 *  4) The only agreed international standard for passing a date between two systems
 *  is the ISO-8601 standard which requires the ISO calendar system. Using this interface
 *  throughout the application will inevitably lead to the requirement to pass the date
 *  across a network or component boundary, requiring an application specific protocol or format.
 *  <p>
 *  5) Long term persistence, such as a database, will almost always only accept dates in the
 *  ISO-8601 calendar system (or the related Julian-Gregorian). Passing around dates in other
 *  calendar systems increases the complications of interacting with persistence.
 *  <p>
 *  6) Most of the time, passing a {@code ChronoLocalDate} throughout an application
 *  is unnecessary, as discussed in the last section below.
 *
 *  <h3>False assumptions causing bugs in multi-calendar system code</h3>
 *  As indicated above, there are many issues to consider when try to use and manipulate a
 *  date in an arbitrary calendar system. These are some of the key issues.
 *  <p>
 *  Code that queries the day-of-month and assumes that the value will never be more than
 *  31 is invalid. Some calendar systems have more than 31 days in some months.
 *  <p>
 *  Code that adds 12 months to a date and assumes that a year has been added is invalid.
 *  Some calendar systems have a different number of months, such as 13 in the Coptic or Ethiopic.
 *  <p>
 *  Code that adds one month to a date and assumes that the month-of-year value will increase
 *  by one or wrap to the next year is invalid. Some calendar systems have a variable number
 *  of months in a year, such as the Hebrew.
 *  <p>
 *  Code that adds one month, then adds a second one month and assumes that the day-of-month
 *  will remain close to its original value is invalid. Some calendar systems have a large difference
 *  between the length of the longest month and the length of the shortest month.
 *  For example, the Coptic or Ethiopic have 12 months of 30 days and 1 month of 5 days.
 *  <p>
 *  Code that adds seven days and assumes that a week has been added is invalid.
 *  Some calendar systems have weeks of other than seven days, such as the French Revolutionary.
 *  <p>
 *  Code that assumes that because the year of {@code date1} is greater than the year of {@code date2}
 *  then {@code date1} is after {@code date2} is invalid. This is invalid for all calendar systems
 *  when referring to the year-of-era, and especially untrue of the Japanese calendar system
 *  where the year-of-era restarts with the reign of every new Emperor.
 *  <p>
 *  Code that treats month-of-year one and day-of-month one as the start of the year is invalid.
 *  Not all calendar systems start the year when the month value is one.
 *  <p>
 *  In general, manipulating a date, and even querying a date, is wide open to bugs when the
 *  calendar system is unknown at development time. This is why it is essential that code using
 *  this interface is subjected to additional code reviews. It is also why an architectural
 *  decision to avoid this interface type is usually the correct one.
 *
 *  <h3>Using LocalDate instead</h3>
 *  The primary alternative to using this interface throughout your application is as follows.
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Declare all method signatures referring to dates in terms of {@code LocalDate}.
 *  <li>Either store the chronology (calendar system) in the user profile or lookup
 *   the chronology from the user locale
 *  <li>Convert the ISO {@code LocalDate} to and from the user's preferred calendar system during
 *   printing and parsing
 *  </ul>
 *  This approach treats the problem of globalized calendar systems as a localization issue
 *  and confines it to the UI layer. This approach is in keeping with other localization
 *  issues in the java platform.
 *  <p>
 *  As discussed above, performing calculations on a date where the rules of the calendar system
 *  are pluggable requires skill and is not recommended.
 *  Fortunately, the need to perform calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system
 *  is extremely rare. For example, it is highly unlikely that the business rules of a library
 *  book rental scheme will allow rentals to be for one month, where meaning of the month
 *  is dependent on the user's preferred calendar system.
 *  <p>
 *  A key use case for calculations on a date in an arbitrary calendar system is producing
 *  a month-by-month calendar for display and user interaction. Again, this is a UI issue,
 *  and use of this interface solely within a few methods of the UI layer may be justified.
 *  <p>
 *  In any other part of the system, where a date must be manipulated in a calendar system
 *  other than ISO, the use case will generally specify the calendar system to use.
 *  For example, an application may need to calculate the next Islamic or Hebrew holiday
 *  which may require manipulating the date.
 *  This kind of use case can be handled as follows:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>start from the ISO {@code LocalDate} being passed to the method
 *  <li>convert the date to the alternate calendar system, which for this use case is known
 *   rather than arbitrary
 *  <li>perform the calculation
 *  <li>convert back to {@code LocalDate}
 *  </ul>
 *  Developers writing low-level frameworks or libraries should also avoid this interface.
 *  Instead, one of the two general purpose access interfaces should be used.
 *  Use {@link TemporalAccessor} if read-only access is required, or use {@link Temporal}
 *  if read-write access is required.
 * @implSpec This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.&#xA; All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.&#xA; Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.&#xA; <p>&#xA; Additional calendar systems may be added to the system.&#xA; See {@link Chronology} for more details.
