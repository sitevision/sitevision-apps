/**
 * An abstract implementation of a calendar system, used to organize and identify dates.

 *  See {@link Chronology} for more details.

While {@code Chronology} can be implemented directly, it is strongly&#xA; recommended to extend this abstract class instead.&#xA; <p>&#xA; This class must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.&#xA; All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.&#xA; Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.

     * Resolves parsed {@code ChronoField} values into a date during parsing.
     *  <p>
     *  Most {@code TemporalField} implementations are resolved using the
     *  resolve method on the field. By contrast, the {@code ChronoField} class
     *  defines fields that only have meaning relative to the chronology.
     *  As such, {@code ChronoField} date fields are resolved here in the
     *  context of a specific chronology.
     *  <p>
     *  {@code ChronoField} instances are resolved by this method, which may
     *  be overridden in subclasses.
     *  <ul>
     *  <li>{@code EPOCH_DAY} - If present, this is converted to a date and
     *   all other date fields are then cross-checked against the date.
     *  <li>{@code PROLEPTIC_MONTH} - If present, then it is split into the
     *   {@code YEAR} and {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}. If the mode is strict or smart
     *   then the field is validated.
     *  <li>{@code YEAR_OF_ERA} and {@code ERA} - If both are present, then they
     *   are combined to form a {@code YEAR}. In lenient mode, the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA}
     *   range is not validated, in smart and strict mode it is. The {@code ERA} is
     *   validated for range in all three modes. If only the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA} is
     *   present, and the mode is smart or lenient, then the last available era
     *   is assumed. In strict mode, no era is assumed and the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA} is
     *   left untouched. If only the {@code ERA} is present, then it is left untouched.
     *  <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR} and {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} -
     *   If all three are present, then they are combined to form a date.
     *   In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated.
     *   If the mode is smart or strict, then the month and day are validated.
     *   If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
     *   creating a date on the first day of the first month in the requested year,
     *   then adding the difference in months, then the difference in days.
     *   If the mode is smart, and the day-of-month is greater than the maximum for
     *   the year-month, then the day-of-month is adjusted to the last day-of-month.
     *   If the mode is strict, then the three fields must form a valid date.
     *  <li>{@code YEAR} and {@code DAY_OF_YEAR} -
     *   If both are present, then they are combined to form a date.
     *   In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated.
     *   If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
     *   creating a date on the first day of the requested year, then adding
     *   the difference in days.
     *   If the mode is smart or strict, then the two fields must form a valid date.
     *  <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}, {@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH} and
     *   {@code ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH} -
     *   If all four are present, then they are combined to form a date.
     *   In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated.
     *   If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
     *   creating a date on the first day of the first month in the requested year, then adding
     *   the difference in months, then the difference in weeks, then in days.
     *   If the mode is smart or strict, then the all four fields are validated to
     *   their outer ranges. The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to
     *   creating a date on the first day of the requested year and month, then adding
     *   the amount in weeks and days to reach their values. If the mode is strict,
     *   the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment
     *   did not change the month.
     *  <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}, {@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH} and
     *   {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} - If all four are present, then they are combined to
     *   form a date. The approach is the same as described above for
     *   years, months and weeks in {@code ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH}.
     *   The day-of-week is adjusted as the next or same matching day-of-week once
     *   the years, months and weeks have been handled.
     *  <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR} and {@code ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR} -
     *   If all three are present, then they are combined to form a date.
     *   In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated.
     *   If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
     *   creating a date on the first day of the requested year, then adding
