/**
 * The ISO calendar system.
 *  <p>
 *  This chronology defines the rules of the ISO calendar system.
 *  This calendar system is based on the ISO-8601 standard, which is the
 *  <i>de facto</i> world calendar.
 *  <p>
 *  The fields are defined as follows:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>era - There are two eras, 'Current Era' (CE) and 'Before Current Era' (BCE).
 *  <li>year-of-era - The year-of-era is the same as the proleptic-year for the current CE era.
 *   For the BCE era before the ISO epoch the year increases from 1 upwards as time goes backwards.
 *  <li>proleptic-year - The proleptic year is the same as the year-of-era for the
 *   current era. For the previous era, years have zero, then negative values.
 *  <li>month-of-year - There are 12 months in an ISO year, numbered from 1 to 12.
 *  <li>day-of-month - There are between 28 and 31 days in each of the ISO month, numbered from 1 to 31.
 *   Months 4, 6, 9 and 11 have 30 days, Months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 12 have 31 days.
 *   Month 2 has 28 days, or 29 in a leap year.
 *  <li>day-of-year - There are 365 days in a standard ISO year and 366 in a leap year.
 *   The days are numbered from 1 to 365 or 1 to 366.
 *  <li>leap-year - Leap years occur every 4 years, except where the year is divisble by 100 and not divisble by 400.
 *  </ul>
 * @implSpec This class is immutable and thread-safe.

     *  {@code ChronoField} instances on the ISO calendar system are resolved
     *  as follows.
     *  <ul>
     *  <li>{@code EPOCH_DAY} - If present, this is converted to a {@code LocalDate}
     *   and all other date fields are then cross-checked against the date.
     *  <li>{@code PROLEPTIC_MONTH} - If present, then it is split into the
     *   {@code YEAR} and {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}. If the mode is strict or smart
     *   then the field is validated.
     *  <li>{@code YEAR_OF_ERA} and {@code ERA} - If both are present, then they
     *   are combined to form a {@code YEAR}. In lenient mode, the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA}
     *   range is not validated, in smart and strict mode it is. The {@code ERA} is
     *   validated for range in all three modes. If only the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA} is
     *   present, and the mode is smart or lenient, then the current era (CE/AD)
     *   is assumed. In strict mode, no era is assumed and the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA} is
     *   left untouched. If only the {@code ERA} is present, then it is left untouched.
     *  <li>{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR} and {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} -
     *   If all three are present, then they are combined to form a {@code LocalDate}.
     *   In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated. If the mode is smart or strict,
     *   then the month and day are validated, with the day validated from 1 to 31.

     *   creating a date on the first of January in the requested year, then adding
     *   the difference in months, then the difference in days.
     *   If the mode is smart, and the day-of-month is greater than the maximum for
     *   the year-month, then the day-of-month is adjusted to the last day-of-month.
     *   If the mode is strict, then the three fields must form a valid date.
     *  <li>{@code YEAR} and {@code DAY_OF_YEAR} -

     *   creating a date on the first of January in the requested year, then adding
     *   the difference in months, then the difference in weeks, then in days.
     *   If the mode is smart or strict, then the all four fields are validated to
     *   their outer ranges. The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to
     *   creating a date on the first day of the requested year and month, then adding
     *   the amount in weeks and days to reach their values. If the mode is strict,
     *   the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment
