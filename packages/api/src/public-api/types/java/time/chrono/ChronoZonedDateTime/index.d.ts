/**
 * A date-time with a time-zone in an arbitrary chronology,
 *  intended for advanced globalization use cases.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Most applications should declare method signatures, fields and variables
 *  as {@link ZonedDateTime}, not this interface.</b>
 *  <p>
 *  A {@code ChronoZonedDateTime} is the abstract representation of an offset date-time
 *  where the {@code Chronology chronology}, or calendar system, is pluggable.
 *  The date-time is defined in terms of fields expressed by {@link TemporalField},
 *  where most common implementations are defined in {@link ChronoField}.
 *  The chronology defines how the calendar system operates and the meaning of
 *  the standard fields.
 *
 *  <h3>When to use this interface</h3>
 *  The design of the API encourages the use of {@code ZonedDateTime} rather than this
 *  interface, even in the case where the application needs to deal with multiple
 *  calendar systems. The rationale for this is explored in detail in {@link ChronoLocalDate}.
 *  <p>
 *  Ensure that the discussion in {@code ChronoLocalDate} has been read and understood
 *  before using this interface.
 * @implSpec This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.&#xA; All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.&#xA; Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.
 * @param <D> the concrete type for the date of this date-time
 * @since 1.8
