/**
 * A time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 *  such as {@code 10:15:30}.
 *  <p>
 *  {@code LocalTime} is an immutable date-time object that represents a time,
 *  often viewed as hour-minute-second.
 *  Time is represented to nanosecond precision.
 *  For example, the value "13:45.30.123456789" can be stored in a {@code LocalTime}.
 *  <p>
 *  This class does not store or represent a date or time-zone.
 *  Instead, it is a description of the local time as seen on a wall clock.
 *  It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
 *  such as an offset or time-zone.
 *  <p>
 *  The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 *  in most of the world. This API assumes that all calendar systems use the same
 *  representation, this class, for time-of-day.
 *
 *  <p>
 *  This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 *  class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 *  ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 *  {@code LocalTime} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 *  The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 * @implSpec This class is immutable and thread-safe.
