/**
 * Formatter for printing and parsing date-time objects.
 *  <p>
 *  This class provides the main application entry point for printing and parsing
 *  and provides common implementations of {@code DateTimeFormatter}:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Using predefined constants, such as {@link #ISO_LOCAL_DATE}</li>
 *  <li>Using pattern letters, such as {@code uuuu-MMM-dd}</li>
 *  <li>Using localized styles, such as {@code long} or {@code medium}</li>
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  More complex formatters are provided by
 *  {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder DateTimeFormatterBuilder}.
 *
 *  <p>
 *  The main date-time classes provide two methods - one for formatting,
 *  {@code format(DateTimeFormatter formatter)}, and one for parsing,
 *  {@code parse(CharSequence text, DateTimeFormatter formatter)}.
 *  <p>For example:
 *  <blockquote><pre>
 *   LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
 *   String text = date.format(formatter);
 *   LocalDate parsedDate = LocalDate.parse(text, formatter);
 *  </pre></blockquote>
 *  <p>
 *  In addition to the format, formatters can be created with desired Locale,
 *  Chronology, ZoneId, and DecimalStyle.
 *  <p>
 *  The {@link #withLocale withLocale} method returns a new formatter that
 *  overrides the locale. The locale affects some aspects of formatting and
 *  parsing. For example, the {@link #ofLocalizedDate ofLocalizedDate} provides a
 *  formatter that uses the locale specific date format.
 *  <p>
 *  The {@link #withChronology withChronology} method returns a new formatter
 *  that overrides the chronology. If overridden, the date-time value is
 *  converted to the chronology before formatting. During parsing the date-time
 *  value is converted to the chronology before it is returned.
 *  <p>
 *  The {@link #withZone withZone} method returns a new formatter that overrides
 *  the zone. If overridden, the date-time value is converted to a ZonedDateTime
 *  with the requested ZoneId before formatting. During parsing the ZoneId is
 *  applied before the value is returned.
 *  <p>
 *  The {@link #withDecimalStyle withDecimalStyle} method returns a new formatter that
 *  overrides the {@link DecimalStyle}. The DecimalStyle symbols are used for
 *  formatting and parsing.
 *  <p>
 *  Some applications may need to use the older {@link Format java.text.Format}
 *  class for formatting. The {@link #toFormat()} method returns an
 *  implementation of {@code java.text.Format}.

 *  <h3 id="patterns">Patterns for Formatting and Parsing</h3>
 *  Patterns are based on a simple sequence of letters and symbols.
 *  A pattern is used to create a Formatter using the
 *  {@link #ofPattern(String)} and {@link #ofPattern(String, Locale)} methods.
 *  For example,
 *  {@code "d MMM uuuu"} will format 2011-12-03 as '3&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;2011'.
 *  A formatter created from a pattern can be used as many times as necessary,
 *  it is immutable and is thread-safe.
 *  <p>
 *  For example:
 *  <blockquote><pre>
 *   LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
 *   DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy MM dd");
 *   String text = date.format(formatter);
 *   LocalDate parsedDate = LocalDate.parse(text, formatter);
 *  </pre></blockquote>
 *  <p>
 *  All letters 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z' are reserved as pattern letters. The
 *  following pattern letters are defined:
 *  <pre>
 *   Symbol  Meaning                     Presentation      Examples

 *  <p>
 *  The count of pattern letters determines the format.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Text</b>: The text style is determined based on the number of pattern
 *  letters used. Less than 4 pattern letters will use the
 *  {@link TextStyle#SHORT short form}. Exactly 4 pattern letters will use the
 *  {@link TextStyle#FULL full form}. Exactly 5 pattern letters will use the
 *  {@link TextStyle#NARROW narrow form}.
 *  Pattern letters 'L', 'c', and 'q' specify the stand-alone form of the text styles.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Number</b>: If the count of letters is one, then the value is output using
 *  the minimum number of digits and without padding. Otherwise, the count of digits
 *  is used as the width of the output field, with the value zero-padded as necessary.
 *  The following pattern letters have constraints on the count of letters.
 *  Only one letter of 'c' and 'F' can be specified.
 *  Up to two letters of 'd', 'H', 'h', 'K', 'k', 'm', and 's' can be specified.
 *  Up to three letters of 'D' can be specified.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Number/Text</b>: If the count of pattern letters is 3 or greater, use the
 *  Text rules above. Otherwise use the Number rules above.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Fraction</b>: Outputs the nano-of-second field as a fraction-of-second.
 *  The nano-of-second value has nine digits, thus the count of pattern letters
 *  is from 1 to 9. If it is less than 9, then the nano-of-second value is
 *  truncated, with only the most significant digits being output.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Year</b>: The count of letters determines the minimum field width below
 *  which padding is used. If the count of letters is two, then a
 *  {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder#appendValueReduced reduced} two digit form is
 *  used. For printing, this outputs the rightmost two digits. For parsing, this
 *  will parse using the base value of 2000, resulting in a year within the range
 *  2000 to 2099 inclusive. If the count of letters is less than four (but not
 *  two), then the sign is only output for negative years as per
 *  {@link SignStyle#NORMAL}. Otherwise, the sign is output if the pad width is
 *  exceeded, as per {@link SignStyle#EXCEEDS_PAD}.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>ZoneId</b>: This outputs the time-zone ID, such as 'Europe/Paris'. If the
 *  count of letters is two, then the time-zone ID is output. Any other count of
 *  letters throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Zone names</b>: This outputs the display name of the time-zone ID. If the
 *  count of letters is one, two or three, then the short name is output. If the
 *  count of letters is four, then the full name is output. Five or more letters
 *  throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Offset X and x</b>: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern
 *  letters. One letter outputs just the hour, such as '+01', unless the minute
 *  is non-zero in which case the minute is also output, such as '+0130'. Two
 *  letters outputs the hour and minute, without a colon, such as '+0130'. Three
 *  letters outputs the hour and minute, with a colon, such as '+01:30'. Four
 *  letters outputs the hour and minute and optional second, without a colon,
 *  such as '+013015'. Five letters outputs the hour and minute and optional
 *  second, with a colon, such as '+01:30:15'. Six or more letters throws
 *  {@code IllegalArgumentException}. Pattern letter 'X' (upper case) will output
 *  'Z' when the offset to be output would be zero, whereas pattern letter 'x'
 *  (lower case) will output '+00', '+0000', or '+00:00'.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Offset O</b>: This formats the localized offset based on the number of
 *  pattern letters. One letter outputs the {@linkplain TextStyle#SHORT short}
 *  form of the localized offset, which is localized offset text, such as 'GMT',
 *  with hour without leading zero, optional 2-digit minute and second if
 *  non-zero, and colon, for example 'GMT+8'. Four letters outputs the
 *  {@linkplain TextStyle#FULL full} form, which is localized offset text,
 *  such as 'GMT, with 2-digit hour and minute field, optional second field
 *  if non-zero, and colon, for example 'GMT+08:00'. Any other count of letters
 *  throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Offset Z</b>: This formats the offset based on the number of pattern
 *  letters. One, two or three letters outputs the hour and minute, without a
 *  colon, such as '+0130'. The output will be '+0000' when the offset is zero.
 *  Four letters outputs the {@linkplain TextStyle#FULL full} form of localized
 *  offset, equivalent to four letters of Offset-O. The output will be the
 *  corresponding localized offset text if the offset is zero. Five
 *  letters outputs the hour, minute, with optional second if non-zero, with
 *  colon. It outputs 'Z' if the offset is zero.
 *  Six or more letters throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Optional section</b>: The optional section markers work exactly like
 *  calling {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder#optionalStart()} and
 *  {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder#optionalEnd()}.
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Pad modifier</b>: Modifies the pattern that immediately follows to be
 *  padded with spaces. The pad width is determined by the number of pattern
 *  letters. This is the same as calling
 *  {@link DateTimeFormatterBuilder#padNext(int)}.
 *  <p>
 *  For example, 'ppH' outputs the hour-of-day padded on the left with spaces to
 *  a width of 2.
 *  <p>
 *  Any unrecognized letter is an error. Any non-letter character, other than
 *  '[', ']', '{', '}', '#' and the single quote will be output directly.
 *  Despite this, it is recommended to use single quotes around all characters
 *  that you want to output directly to ensure that future changes do not break
 *  your application.
 *
 *  <h3 id="resolving">Resolving</h3>
 *  Parsing is implemented as a two-phase operation.
 *  First, the text is parsed using the layout defined by the formatter, producing
 *  a {@code Map} of field to value, a {@code ZoneId} and a {@code Chronology}.
 *  Second, the parsed data is <em>resolved</em>, by validating, combining and
 *  simplifying the various fields into more useful ones.
 *  <p>
 *  Five parsing methods are supplied by this class.
 *  Four of these perform both the parse and resolve phases.
 *  The fifth method, {@link #parseUnresolved(CharSequence, ParsePosition)},
 *  only performs the first phase, leaving the result unresolved.
 *  As such, it is essentially a low-level operation.
 *  <p>
 *  The resolve phase is controlled by two parameters, set on this class.
 *  <p>
 *  The {@link ResolverStyle} is an enum that offers three different approaches,
 *  strict, smart and lenient. The smart option is the default.
 *  It can be set using {@link #withResolverStyle(ResolverStyle)}.
 *  <p>
 *  The {@link #withResolverFields(TemporalField...)} parameter allows the
 *  set of fields that will be resolved to be filtered before resolving starts.
 *  For example, if the formatter has parsed a year, month, day-of-month
 *  and day-of-year, then there are two approaches to resolve a date:
 *  (year + month + day-of-month) and (year + day-of-year).
 *  The resolver fields allows one of the two approaches to be selected.
 *  If no resolver fields are set then both approaches must result in the same date.
 *  <p>
 *  Resolving separate fields to form a complete date and time is a complex
 *  process with behaviour distributed across a number of classes.
 *  It follows these steps:
 *  <ol>
 *  <li>The chronology is determined.
 *  The chronology of the result is either the chronology that was parsed,
 *  or if no chronology was parsed, it is the chronology set on this class,
 *  or if that is null, it is {@code IsoChronology}.
 *  <li>The {@code ChronoField} date fields are resolved.
 *  This is achieved using {@link Chronology#resolveDate(Map, ResolverStyle)}.
 *  Documentation about field resolution is located in the implementation
 *  of {@code Chronology}.
 *  <li>The {@code ChronoField} time fields are resolved.
 *  This is documented on {@link ChronoField} and is the same for all chronologies.
 *  <li>Any fields that are not {@code ChronoField} are processed.
 *  This is achieved using {@link TemporalField#resolve(Map, TemporalAccessor, ResolverStyle)}.
 *  Documentation about field resolution is located in the implementation
 *  of {@code TemporalField}.
 *  <li>The {@code ChronoField} date and time fields are re-resolved.
 *  This allows fields in step four to produce {@code ChronoField} values
 *  and have them be processed into dates and times.
 *  <li>A {@code LocalTime} is formed if there is at least an hour-of-day available.
 *  This involves providing default values for minute, second and fraction of second.
 *  <li>Any remaining unresolved fields are cross-checked against any
 *  date and/or time that was resolved. Thus, an earlier stage would resolve
 *  (year + month + day-of-month) to a date, and this stage would check that
 *  day-of-week was valid for the date.
 *  <li>If an {@linkplain #parsedExcessDays() excess number of days}
 *  was parsed then it is added to the date if a date is available.
 *  </ol>
