     *  <ul>
     *  <li>Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal

     *   In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.</li>
     *  <li>Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically

     *   In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.</li>
     *  </ul>
     *  Thus, for any given local date-time there can be zero, one or two valid offsets.
     *  This method returns the single offset in the Normal case, and in the Gap or Overlap
     *  case it returns the offset before the transition.
     *  <p>
     *  Since, in the case of Gap and Overlap, the offset returned is a "best" value, rather
     *  than the "correct" value, it should be treated with care. Applications that care
     *  about the correct offset should use a combination of this method,
     *  {@link #getValidOffsets(LocalDateTime)} and {@link #getTransition(LocalDateTime)}.
