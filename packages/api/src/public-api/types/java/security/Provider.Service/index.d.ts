/**
 * The description of a security service. It encapsulates the properties
 *  of a service and contains a factory method to obtain new implementation
 *  instances of this service.
 *
 *  <p>Each service has a provider that offers the service, a type,
 *  an algorithm name, and the name of the class that implements the
 *  service. Optionally, it also includes a list of alternate algorithm
 *  names for this service (aliases) and attributes, which are a map of
 *  (name, value) String pairs.
 *
 *  <p>This class defines the methods {@link #supportsParameter
 *  supportsParameter()} and {@link #newInstance newInstance()}
 *  which are used by the Java security framework when it searches for
 *  suitable services and instantiates them. The valid arguments to those
 *  methods depend on the type of service. For the service types defined
 *  within Java SE, see the
 *  <a href="../../../technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html">
 *  Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification &amp; Reference </a>
 *  for the valid values.
 *  Note that components outside of Java SE can define additional types of
 *  services and their behavior.
 *
 *  <p>Instances of this class are immutable.
