/**
 * Abstract class for representing access to a system resource.
 *  All permissions have a name (whose interpretation depends on the subclass),
 *  as well as abstract functions for defining the semantics of the
 *  particular Permission subclass.
 *
 *  <p>Most Permission objects also include an "actions" list that tells the actions
 *  that are permitted for the object.  For example,
 *  for a {@code java.io.FilePermission} object, the permission name is
 *  the pathname of a file (or directory), and the actions list
 *  (such as "read, write") specifies which actions are granted for the
 *  specified file (or for files in the specified directory).
 *  The actions list is optional for Permission objects, such as
 *  {@code java.lang.RuntimePermission},
 *  that don't need such a list; you either have the named permission (such
 *  as "system.exit") or you don't.
 *
 *  <p>An important method that must be implemented by each subclass is
 *  the {@code implies} method to compare Permissions. Basically,
 *  "permission p1 implies permission p2" means that
 *  if one is granted permission p1, one is naturally granted permission p2.
 *  Thus, this is not an equality test, but rather more of a
 *  subset test.
 *
 *  <P> Permission objects are similar to String objects in that they
 *  are immutable once they have been created. Subclasses should not
 *  provide methods that can change the state of a permission
 *  once it has been created.
