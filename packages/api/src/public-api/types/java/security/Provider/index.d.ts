/**
 * This class represents a "provider" for the
 *  Java Security API, where a provider implements some or all parts of
 *  Java Security. Services that a provider may implement include:
 *
 *  <ul>
 *
 *  <li>Algorithms (such as DSA, RSA, MD5 or SHA-1).
 *
 *  <li>Key generation, conversion, and management facilities (such as for
 *  algorithm-specific keys).
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 *  <p>Each provider has a name and a version number, and is configured
 *  in each runtime it is installed in.
 *
 *  <p>See <a href =
 *  "../../../technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#Provider">The Provider Class</a>
 *  in the "Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification &amp; Reference"
 *  for information about how a particular type of provider, the
 *  cryptographic service provider, works and is installed. However,
 *  please note that a provider can be used to implement any security
 *  service in Java that uses a pluggable architecture with a choice
 *  of implementations that fit underneath.
 *
 *  <p>Some provider implementations may encounter unrecoverable internal
 *  errors during their operation, for example a failure to communicate with a
 *  security token. A {@link ProviderException} should be used to indicate
 *  such errors.
 *
 *  <p>The service type {@code Provider} is reserved for use by the
 *  security framework. Services of this type cannot be added, removed,
 *  or modified by applications.
 *  The following attributes are automatically placed in each Provider object:
 *  <table cellspacing=4>
 *  <caption><b>Attributes Automatically Placed in a Provider Object</b></caption>
 *  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Value</th>
 *  <tr><td>{@code Provider.id name}</td>
