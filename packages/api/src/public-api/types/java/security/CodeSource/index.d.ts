     *  <ul>
     *  <li> <i>codesource</i> must not be null.
     *  <li> If this object's certificates are not null, then all
     *  of this object's certificates must be present in <i>codesource</i>'s
     *  certificates.
     *  <li> If this object's location (getLocation()) is not null, then the
     *  following checks are made against this object's location and
     *  <i>codesource</i>'s:
     *    <ul>
     *      <li>  <i>codesource</i>'s location must not be null.
     *
     *      <li>  If this object's location
     *            equals <i>codesource</i>'s location, then return true.
     *
     *      <li>  This object's protocol (getLocation().getProtocol()) must be
     *            equal to <i>codesource</i>'s protocol, ignoring case.
     *
     *      <li>  If this object's host (getLocation().getHost()) is not null,
     *            then the SocketPermission
     *            constructed with this object's host must imply the
     *            SocketPermission constructed with <i>codesource</i>'s host.
     *
     *      <li>  If this object's port (getLocation().getPort()) is not
     *            equal to -1 (that is, if a port is specified), it must equal
     *            <i>codesource</i>'s port or default port
     *            (codesource.getLocation().getDefaultPort()).
     *
     *      <li>  If this object's file (getLocation().getFile()) doesn't equal
     *            <i>codesource</i>'s file, then the following checks are made:
     *            If this object's file ends with "/-",
     *            then <i>codesource</i>'s file must start with this object's
     *            file (exclusive the trailing "-").
     *            If this object's file ends with a "/*",
     *            then <i>codesource</i>'s file must start with this object's
     *            file and must not have any further "/" separators.
     *            If this object's file doesn't end with a "/",
     *            then <i>codesource</i>'s file must match this object's
     *            file with a '/' appended.
     *
     *      <li>  If this object's reference (getLocation().getRef()) is
     *            not null, it must equal <i>codesource</i>'s reference.
     *

     *  </pre>

     *  certificate chain, then it implies every other CodeSource.
