/**
 * The Key interface is the top-level interface for all keys. It
 *  defines the functionality shared by all key objects. All keys
 *  have three characteristics:
 *
 *  <UL>
 *
 *  <LI>An Algorithm
 *
 *  <P>This is the key algorithm for that key. The key algorithm is usually
 *  an encryption or asymmetric operation algorithm (such as DSA or
 *  RSA), which will work with those algorithms and with related
 *  algorithms (such as MD5 with RSA, SHA-1 with RSA, Raw DSA, etc.)
 *  The name of the algorithm of a key is obtained using the
 *  {@link #getAlgorithm() getAlgorithm} method.
 *
 *  <LI>An Encoded Form
 *
 *  <P>This is an external encoded form for the key used when a standard
 *  representation of the key is needed outside the Java Virtual Machine,
 *  as when transmitting the key to some other party. The key
 *  is encoded according to a standard format (such as
 *  X.509 {@code SubjectPublicKeyInfo} or PKCS#8), and
 *  is returned using the {@link #getEncoded() getEncoded} method.
 *  Note: The syntax of the ASN.1 type {@code SubjectPublicKeyInfo}
 *  is defined as follows:
 *
 *  <pre>
 *  SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
 *    algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
 *    subjectPublicKey BIT STRING }
 *
 *  AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
 *    algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
 *    parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  For more information, see
 *  <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280">RFC 5280:
 *  Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile</a>.
 *
 *  <LI>A Format
 *
 *  <P>This is the name of the format of the encoded key. It is returned
 *  by the {@link #getFormat() getFormat} method.
 *
 *  </UL>
 *
 *  Keys are generally obtained through key generators, certificates,
 *  or various Identity classes used to manage keys.
 *  Keys may also be obtained from key specifications (transparent
 *  representations of the underlying key material) through the use of a key
 *  factory (see {@link KeyFactory}).
 *
 *  <p> A Key should use KeyRep as its serialized representation.
 *  Note that a serialized Key may contain sensitive information
 *  which should not be exposed in untrusted environments.  See the
 *  <a href="../../../platform/serialization/spec/security.html">
 *  Security Appendix</a>
 *  of the Serialization Specification for more information.
