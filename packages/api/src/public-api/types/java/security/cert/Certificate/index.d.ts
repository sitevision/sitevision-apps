/**
 * <p>Abstract class for managing a variety of identity certificates.
 *  An identity certificate is a binding of a principal to a public key which
 *  is vouched for by another principal.  (A principal represents
 *  an entity such as an individual user, a group, or a corporation.)
 * <p>
 *  This class is an abstraction for certificates that have different
 *  formats but important common uses.  For example, different types of
 *  certificates, such as X.509 and PGP, share general certificate
 *  functionality (like encoding and verifying) and
 *  some types of information (like a public key).
 *  <p>
 *  X.509, PGP, and SDSI certificates can all be implemented by
 *  subclassing the Certificate class, even though they contain different
 *  sets of information, and they store and retrieve the information in
 *  different ways.
 * @see X509Certificate
