/**
 * This interface defines a protocol for bidirectional iteration over text.
 *  The iterator iterates over a bounded sequence of characters.  Characters
 *  are indexed with values beginning with the value returned by getBeginIndex() and
 *  continuing through the value returned by getEndIndex()-1.
 *  <p>
 *  Iterators maintain a current character index, whose valid range is from
 *  getBeginIndex() to getEndIndex(); the value getEndIndex() is included to allow
 *  handling of zero-length text ranges and for historical reasons.
 *  The current index can be retrieved by calling getIndex() and set directly
 *  by calling setIndex(), first(), and last().
 *  <p>
 *  The methods previous() and next() are used for iteration. They return DONE if
 *  they would move outside the range from getBeginIndex() to getEndIndex() -1,
 *  signaling that the iterator has reached the end of the sequence. DONE is
 *  also returned by other methods to indicate that the current index is
 *  outside this range.
 *
 *  <P>Examples:<P>
 *
 *  Traverse the text from start to finish
 *  <pre>{@code
 *  public void traverseForward(CharacterIterator iter) {
 *      for(char c = iter.first(); c != CharacterIterator.DONE; c = iter.next()) {
 *          processChar(c);
 *      }
 *  }
 *  }</pre>
 *
 *  Traverse the text backwards, from end to start
 *  <pre>{@code
 *  public void traverseBackward(CharacterIterator iter) {
 *      for(char c = iter.last(); c != CharacterIterator.DONE; c = iter.previous()) {
 *          processChar(c);
 *      }
 *  }
 *  }</pre>
 *
 *  Traverse both forward and backward from a given position in the text.
 *  Calls to notBoundary() in this example represents some
 *  additional stopping criteria.
 *  <pre>{@code
 *  public void traverseOut(CharacterIterator iter, int pos) {
 *      for (char c = iter.setIndex(pos);
 *               c != CharacterIterator.DONE && notBoundary(c);
 *               c = iter.next()) {
 *      }
 *      int end = iter.getIndex();
 *      for (char c = iter.setIndex(pos);
 *              c != CharacterIterator.DONE && notBoundary(c);
 *              c = iter.previous()) {
 *      }
 *      int start = iter.getIndex();
 *      processSection(start, end);
 *  }
 *  }</pre>
