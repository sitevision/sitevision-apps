/**
 * Immutable, arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers.  A
 *  {@code BigDecimal} consists of an arbitrary precision integer
 *  <i>unscaled value</i> and a 32-bit integer <i>scale</i>.  If zero
 *  or positive, the scale is the number of digits to the right of the
 *  decimal point.  If negative, the unscaled value of the number is
 *  multiplied by ten to the power of the negation of the scale.  The
 *  value of the number represented by the {@code BigDecimal} is
 *  therefore <tt>(unscaledValue &times; 10<sup>-scale</sup>)</tt>.
 *
 *  <p>The {@code BigDecimal} class provides operations for
 *  arithmetic, scale manipulation, rounding, comparison, hashing, and
 *  format conversion.  The {@link #toString} method provides a
 *  canonical representation of a {@code BigDecimal}.
 *
 *  <p>The {@code BigDecimal} class gives its user complete control
 *  over rounding behavior.  If no rounding mode is specified and the
 *  exact result cannot be represented, an exception is thrown;
 *  otherwise, calculations can be carried out to a chosen precision
 *  and rounding mode by supplying an appropriate {@link MathContext}
 *  object to the operation.  In either case, eight <em>rounding
 *  modes</em> are provided for the control of rounding.  Using the
 *  integer fields in this class (such as {@link #ROUND_HALF_UP}) to
 *  represent rounding mode is largely obsolete; the enumeration values
 *  of the {@code RoundingMode} {@code enum}, (such as {@link
 *  RoundingMode#HALF_UP}) should be used instead.
 *
 *  <p>When a {@code MathContext} object is supplied with a precision
 *  setting of 0 (for example, {@link MathContext#UNLIMITED}),
 *  arithmetic operations are exact, as are the arithmetic methods
 *  which take no {@code MathContext} object.  (This is the only
 *  behavior that was supported in releases prior to 5.)  As a
 *  corollary of computing the exact result, the rounding mode setting
 *  of a {@code MathContext} object with a precision setting of 0 is
 *  not used and thus irrelevant.  In the case of divide, the exact
 *  quotient could have an infinitely long decimal expansion; for
 *  example, 1 divided by 3.  If the quotient has a nonterminating
 *  decimal expansion and the operation is specified to return an exact
 *  result, an {@code ArithmeticException} is thrown.  Otherwise, the
 *  exact result of the division is returned, as done for other
 *  operations.
 *
 *  <p>When the precision setting is not 0, the rules of
 *  {@code BigDecimal} arithmetic are broadly compatible with selected
 *  modes of operation of the arithmetic defined in ANSI X3.274-1996
 *  and ANSI X3.274-1996/AM 1-2000 (section 7.4).  Unlike those
 *  standards, {@code BigDecimal} includes many rounding modes, which
 *  were mandatory for division in {@code BigDecimal} releases prior
 *  to 5.  Any conflicts between these ANSI standards and the
 *  {@code BigDecimal} specification are resolved in favor of
 *  {@code BigDecimal}.
 *
 *  <p>Since the same numerical value can have different
 *  representations (with different scales), the rules of arithmetic
 *  and rounding must specify both the numerical result and the scale
 *  used in the result's representation.
 *
 *
 *  <p>In general the rounding modes and precision setting determine
 *  how operations return results with a limited number of digits when
 *  the exact result has more digits (perhaps infinitely many in the
 *  case of division) than the number of digits returned.
 *
 *  First, the
 *  total number of digits to return is specified by the
 *  {@code MathContext}'s {@code precision} setting; this determines
 *  the result's <i>precision</i>.  The digit count starts from the
 *  leftmost nonzero digit of the exact result.  The rounding mode
 *  determines how any discarded trailing digits affect the returned
 *  result.
 *
 *  <p>For all arithmetic operators , the operation is carried out as
 *  though an exact intermediate result were first calculated and then
 *  rounded to the number of digits specified by the precision setting
 *  (if necessary), using the selected rounding mode.  If the exact
 *  result is not returned, some digit positions of the exact result
 *  are discarded.  When rounding increases the magnitude of the
 *  returned result, it is possible for a new digit position to be
 *  created by a carry propagating to a leading {@literal "9"} digit.
 *  For example, rounding the value 999.9 to three digits rounding up
 *  would be numerically equal to one thousand, represented as
 *  100&times;10<sup>1</sup>.  In such cases, the new {@literal "1"} is
 *  the leading digit position of the returned result.
 *
 *  <p>Besides a logical exact result, each arithmetic operation has a
 *  preferred scale for representing a result.  The preferred
 *  scale for each operation is listed in the table below.
 *
 *  <table border>
 *  <caption><b>Preferred Scales for Results of Arithmetic Operations
 *  </b></caption>
 *  <tr><th>Operation</th><th>Preferred Scale of Result</th></tr>
 *  <tr><td>Add</td><td>max(addend.scale(), augend.scale())</td>
 *  <tr><td>Subtract</td><td>max(minuend.scale(), subtrahend.scale())</td>
 *  <tr><td>Multiply</td><td>multiplier.scale() + multiplicand.scale()</td>
 *  <tr><td>Divide</td><td>dividend.scale() - divisor.scale()</td>
 *  </table>
 *
 *  These scales are the ones used by the methods which return exact
 *  arithmetic results; except that an exact divide may have to use a
 *  larger scale since the exact result may have more digits.  For
 *  example, {@code 1/32} is {@code 0.03125}.
 *
 *  <p>Before rounding, the scale of the logical exact intermediate
 *  result is the preferred scale for that operation.  If the exact
 *  numerical result cannot be represented in {@code precision}
 *  digits, rounding selects the set of digits to return and the scale
 *  of the result is reduced from the scale of the intermediate result
 *  to the least scale which can represent the {@code precision}
 *  digits actually returned.  If the exact result can be represented
 *  with at most {@code precision} digits, the representation
 *  of the result with the scale closest to the preferred scale is
 *  returned.  In particular, an exactly representable quotient may be
 *  represented in fewer than {@code precision} digits by removing
 *  trailing zeros and decreasing the scale.  For example, rounding to
 *  three digits using the {@linkplain RoundingMode#FLOOR floor}
 *  rounding mode, <br>
 *
 *  {@code 19/100 = 0.19   // integer=19,  scale=2} <br>
 *
 *  but<br>
 *
 *  {@code 21/110 = 0.190  // integer=190, scale=3} <br>
 *
 *  <p>Note that for add, subtract, and multiply, the reduction in
 *  scale will equal the number of digit positions of the exact result
 *  which are discarded. If the rounding causes a carry propagation to
 *  create a new high-order digit position, an additional digit of the
 *  result is discarded than when no new digit position is created.
 *
 *  <p>Other methods may have slightly different rounding semantics.
 *  For example, the result of the {@code pow} method using the
 *  {@linkplain #pow(int, MathContext) specified algorithm} can
 *  occasionally differ from the rounded mathematical result by more
 *  than one unit in the last place, one <i>{@linkplain #ulp() ulp}</i>.
 *
 *  <p>Two types of operations are provided for manipulating the scale
 *  of a {@code BigDecimal}: scaling/rounding operations and decimal
 *  point motion operations.  Scaling/rounding operations ({@link
 *  #setScale setScale} and {@link #round round}) return a
 *  {@code BigDecimal} whose value is approximately (or exactly) equal
 *  to that of the operand, but whose scale or precision is the
 *  specified value; that is, they increase or decrease the precision
 *  of the stored number with minimal effect on its value.  Decimal
 *  point motion operations ({@link #movePointLeft movePointLeft} and
 *  {@link #movePointRight movePointRight}) return a
 *  {@code BigDecimal} created from the operand by moving the decimal
 *  point a specified distance in the specified direction.
 *
 *  <p>For the sake of brevity and clarity, pseudo-code is used
 *  throughout the descriptions of {@code BigDecimal} methods.  The
 *  pseudo-code expression {@code (i + j)} is shorthand for "a
 *  {@code BigDecimal} whose value is that of the {@code BigDecimal}
 *  {@code i} added to that of the {@code BigDecimal}
 *  {@code j}." The pseudo-code expression {@code (i == j)} is
 *  shorthand for "{@code true} if and only if the
 *  {@code BigDecimal} {@code i} represents the same value as the
 *  {@code BigDecimal} {@code j}." Other pseudo-code expressions
 *  are interpreted similarly.  Square brackets are used to represent
 *  the particular {@code BigInteger} and scale pair defining a
 *  {@code BigDecimal} value; for example [19, 2] is the
 *  {@code BigDecimal} numerically equal to 0.19 having a scale of 2.
 *
 *  <p>Note: care should be exercised if {@code BigDecimal} objects
 *  are used as keys in a {@link java.util.SortedMap SortedMap} or
 *  elements in a {@link java.util.SortedSet SortedSet} since
 *  {@code BigDecimal}'s <i>natural ordering</i> is <i>inconsistent
 *  with equals</i>.  See {@link Comparable}, {@link
 *  java.util.SortedMap} or {@link java.util.SortedSet} for more
 *  information.
 *
 *  <p>All methods and constructors for this class throw
 *  {@code NullPointerException} when passed a {@code null} object
 *  reference for any input parameter.

     *  is created as though by the following steps: first, the

     *  {@code '0'} through {@code '9'} with no leading zeros (except

     *  character is used).
     *
     *  <p>Next, an <i>adjusted exponent</i> is calculated; this is the
     *  negated scale, plus the number of characters in the converted
     *  unscaled value, less one.  That is,
     *  {@code -scale+(ulength-1)}, where {@code ulength} is the
     *  length of the absolute value of the unscaled value in decimal
     *  digits (its <i>precision</i>).
     *
     *  <p>If the scale is greater than or equal to zero and the
     *  adjusted exponent is greater than or equal to {@code -6}, the
     *  number will be converted to a character form without using
     *  exponential notation.  In this case, if the scale is zero then
     *  no decimal point is added and if the scale is positive a
     *  decimal point will be inserted with the scale specifying the
     *  number of characters to the right of the decimal point.
     *  {@code '0'} characters are added to the left of the converted
     *  unscaled value as necessary.  If no character precedes the
     *  decimal point after this insertion then a conventional
     *  {@code '0'} character is prefixed.
     *
     *  <p>Otherwise (that is, if the scale is negative, or the
     *  adjusted exponent is less than {@code -6}), the number will be
     *  converted to a character form using exponential notation.  In
     *  this case, if the converted {@code BigInteger} has more than
     *  one digit a decimal point is inserted after the first digit.
     *  An exponent in character form is then suffixed to the converted
     *  unscaled value (perhaps with inserted decimal point); this
     *  comprises the letter {@code 'E'} followed immediately by the
     *  adjusted exponent converted to a character form.  The latter is
     *  in base ten, using the characters {@code '0'} through
     *  {@code '9'} with no leading zeros, and is always prefixed by a
     *  sign character {@code '-'} (<tt>'&#92;u002D'</tt>) if the
     *  adjusted exponent is negative, {@code '+'}
     *  (<tt>'&#92;u002B'</tt>) otherwise).
     *
     *  <p>Finally, the entire string is prefixed by a minus sign
     *  character {@code '-'} (<tt>'&#92;u002D'</tt>) if the unscaled
     *  value is less than zero.  No sign character is prefixed if the
     *  unscaled value is zero or positive.
