/**
 * Immutable arbitrary-precision integers.  All operations behave as if
 *  BigIntegers were represented in two's-complement notation (like Java's
 *  primitive integer types).  BigInteger provides analogues to all of Java's
 *  primitive integer operators, and all relevant methods from java.lang.Math.
 *  Additionally, BigInteger provides operations for modular arithmetic, GCD
 *  calculation, primality testing, prime generation, bit manipulation,
 *  and a few other miscellaneous operations.
 *
 *  <p>Semantics of arithmetic operations exactly mimic those of Java's integer
 *  arithmetic operators, as defined in <i>The Java Language Specification</i>.
 *  For example, division by zero throws an {@code ArithmeticException}, and
 *  division of a negative by a positive yields a negative (or zero) remainder.
 *  All of the details in the Spec concerning overflow are ignored, as
 *  BigIntegers are made as large as necessary to accommodate the results of an
 *  operation.
 *
 *  <p>Semantics of shift operations extend those of Java's shift operators
 *  to allow for negative shift distances.  A right-shift with a negative
 *  shift distance results in a left shift, and vice-versa.  The unsigned
 *  right shift operator ({@code >>>}) is omitted, as this operation makes
 *  little sense in combination with the "infinite word size" abstraction
 *  provided by this class.
 *
 *  <p>Semantics of bitwise logical operations exactly mimic those of Java's
 *  bitwise integer operators.  The binary operators ({@code and},
 *  {@code or}, {@code xor}) implicitly perform sign extension on the shorter
 *  of the two operands prior to performing the operation.
 *
 *  <p>Comparison operations perform signed integer comparisons, analogous to
 *  those performed by Java's relational and equality operators.
 *
 *  <p>Modular arithmetic operations are provided to compute residues, perform
 *  exponentiation, and compute multiplicative inverses.  These methods always
 *  return a non-negative result, between {@code 0} and {@code (modulus - 1)},
 *  inclusive.
 *
 *  <p>Bit operations operate on a single bit of the two's-complement
 *  representation of their operand.  If necessary, the operand is sign-
 *  extended so that it contains the designated bit.  None of the single-bit
 *  operations can produce a BigInteger with a different sign from the
 *  BigInteger being operated on, as they affect only a single bit, and the
 *  "infinite word size" abstraction provided by this class ensures that there
 *  are infinitely many "virtual sign bits" preceding each BigInteger.
 *
 *  <p>For the sake of brevity and clarity, pseudo-code is used throughout the
 *  descriptions of BigInteger methods.  The pseudo-code expression
 *  {@code (i + j)} is shorthand for "a BigInteger whose value is
 *  that of the BigInteger {@code i} plus that of the BigInteger {@code j}."
 *  The pseudo-code expression {@code (i == j)} is shorthand for
 *  "{@code true} if and only if the BigInteger {@code i} represents the same
 *  value as the BigInteger {@code j}."  Other pseudo-code expressions are
 *  interpreted similarly.
 *
 *  <p>All methods and constructors in this class throw
 *  {@code NullPointerException} when passed
 *  a null object reference for any input parameter.
 *
 *  BigInteger must support values in the range
 *  -2<sup>{@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}</sup> (exclusive) to
 *  +2<sup>{@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}</sup> (exclusive)
 *  and may support values outside of that range.
 *
 *  The range of probable prime values is limited and may be less than
 *  the full supported positive range of {@code BigInteger}.
 *  The range must be at least 1 to 2<sup>500000000</sup>.
 * @implNote BigInteger constructors and operations throw {@code ArithmeticException} when&#xA; the result is out of the supported range of&#xA; -2<sup>{@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}</sup> (exclusive) to&#xA; +2<sup>{@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}</sup> (exclusive).
