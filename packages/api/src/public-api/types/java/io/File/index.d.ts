/**
 * An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames.
 *
 *  <p> User interfaces and operating systems use system-dependent <em>pathname
 *  strings</em> to name files and directories.  This class presents an
 *  abstract, system-independent view of hierarchical pathnames.  An
 *  <em>abstract pathname</em> has two components:
 *
 *  <ol>
 *  <li> An optional system-dependent <em>prefix</em> string,
 *       such as a disk-drive specifier, <code>"/"</code>&nbsp;for the UNIX root
 *       directory, or <code>"\\\\"</code>&nbsp;for a Microsoft Windows UNC pathname, and
 *  <li> A sequence of zero or more string <em>names</em>.
 *  </ol>
 *
 *  The first name in an abstract pathname may be a directory name or, in the
 *  case of Microsoft Windows UNC pathnames, a hostname.  Each subsequent name
 *  in an abstract pathname denotes a directory; the last name may denote
 *  either a directory or a file.  The <em>empty</em> abstract pathname has no
 *  prefix and an empty name sequence.
 *
 *  <p> The conversion of a pathname string to or from an abstract pathname is
 *  inherently system-dependent.  When an abstract pathname is converted into a
 *  pathname string, each name is separated from the next by a single copy of
 *  the default <em>separator character</em>.  The default name-separator
 *  character is defined by the system property <code>file.separator</code>, and
 *  is made available in the public static fields <code>{@link
 *  #separator}</code> and <code>{@link #separatorChar}</code> of this class.
 *  When a pathname string is converted into an abstract pathname, the names
 *  within it may be separated by the default name-separator character or by any
 *  other name-separator character that is supported by the underlying system.
 *
 *  <p> A pathname, whether abstract or in string form, may be either
 *  <em>absolute</em> or <em>relative</em>.  An absolute pathname is complete in
 *  that no other information is required in order to locate the file that it
 *  denotes.  A relative pathname, in contrast, must be interpreted in terms of
 *  information taken from some other pathname.  By default the classes in the
 *  <code>java.io</code> package always resolve relative pathnames against the
 *  current user directory.  This directory is named by the system property
 *  <code>user.dir</code>, and is typically the directory in which the Java
 *  virtual machine was invoked.
 *
 *  <p> The <em>parent</em> of an abstract pathname may be obtained by invoking
 *  the {@link #getParent} method of this class and consists of the pathname's
 *  prefix and each name in the pathname's name sequence except for the last.
 *  Each directory's absolute pathname is an ancestor of any <tt>File</tt>
 *  object with an absolute abstract pathname which begins with the directory's
 *  absolute pathname.  For example, the directory denoted by the abstract
 *  pathname <tt>"/usr"</tt> is an ancestor of the directory denoted by the
 *  pathname <tt>"/usr/local/bin"</tt>.
 *
 *  <p> The prefix concept is used to handle root directories on UNIX platforms,
 *  and drive specifiers, root directories and UNC pathnames on Microsoft Windows platforms,
 *  as follows:
 *
 *  <ul>
 *
 *  <li> For UNIX platforms, the prefix of an absolute pathname is always
 *  <code>"/"</code>.  Relative pathnames have no prefix.  The abstract pathname
 *  denoting the root directory has the prefix <code>"/"</code> and an empty
 *  name sequence.
 *
 *  <li> For Microsoft Windows platforms, the prefix of a pathname that contains a drive
 *  specifier consists of the drive letter followed by <code>":"</code> and
 *  possibly followed by <code>"\\"</code> if the pathname is absolute.  The
 *  prefix of a UNC pathname is <code>"\\\\"</code>; the hostname and the share
 *  name are the first two names in the name sequence.  A relative pathname that
 *  does not specify a drive has no prefix.
 *
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p> Instances of this class may or may not denote an actual file-system
 *  object such as a file or a directory.  If it does denote such an object
 *  then that object resides in a <i>partition</i>.  A partition is an
 *  operating system-specific portion of storage for a file system.  A single
 *  storage device (e.g. a physical disk-drive, flash memory, CD-ROM) may
 *  contain multiple partitions.  The object, if any, will reside on the
 *  partition <a name="partName">named</a> by some ancestor of the absolute
 *  form of this pathname.
 *
 *  <p> A file system may implement restrictions to certain operations on the
 *  actual file-system object, such as reading, writing, and executing.  These
 *  restrictions are collectively known as <i>access permissions</i>.  The file
 *  system may have multiple sets of access permissions on a single object.
 *  For example, one set may apply to the object's <i>owner</i>, and another
 *  may apply to all other users.  The access permissions on an object may
 *  cause some methods in this class to fail.
 *
 *  <p> Instances of the <code>File</code> class are immutable; that is, once
 *  created, the abstract pathname represented by a <code>File</code> object
 *  will never change.
 *
 *  <h3>Interoperability with {@code java.nio.file} package</h3>
 *
 *  <p> The <a href="../../java/nio/file/package-summary.html">{@code java.nio.file}</a>
 *  package defines interfaces and classes for the Java virtual machine to access
 *  files, file attributes, and file systems. This API may be used to overcome
 *  many of the limitations of the {@code java.io.File} class.
 *  The {@link #toPath toPath} method may be used to obtain a {@link
 *  Path} that uses the abstract path represented by a {@code File} object to
 *  locate a file. The resulting {@code Path} may be used with the {@link
 *  java.nio.file.Files} class to provide more efficient and extensive access to
 *  additional file operations, file attributes, and I/O exceptions to help
 *  diagnose errors when an operation on a file fails.
