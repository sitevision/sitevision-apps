/**
 * This class represents an Internet Protocol (IP) address.
 *
 *  <p> An IP address is either a 32-bit or 128-bit unsigned number
 *  used by IP, a lower-level protocol on which protocols like UDP and
 *  TCP are built. The IP address architecture is defined by <a
 *  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc790.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;790:
 *  Assigned Numbers</i></a>, <a
 *  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt"> <i>RFC&nbsp;1918:
 *  Address Allocation for Private Internets</i></a>, <a
 *  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2365.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2365:
 *  Administratively Scoped IP Multicast</i></a>, and <a
 *  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2373.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2373: IP
 *  Version 6 Addressing Architecture</i></a>. An instance of an
 *  InetAddress consists of an IP address and possibly its
 *  corresponding host name (depending on whether it is constructed
 *  with a host name or whether it has already done reverse host name
 *  resolution).
 *
 *  <h3> Address types </h3>
 *
 *  <blockquote><table cellspacing=2 summary="Description of unicast and multicast address types">
 *    <tr><th valign=top><i>unicast</i></th>
 *        <td>An identifier for a single interface. A packet sent to
 *          a unicast address is delivered to the interface identified by
 *          that address.
 *
 *          <p> The Unspecified Address -- Also called anylocal or wildcard
 *          address. It must never be assigned to any node. It indicates the
 *          absence of an address. One example of its use is as the target of
 *          bind, which allows a server to accept a client connection on any
 *          interface, in case the server host has multiple interfaces.
 *
 *          <p> The <i>unspecified</i> address must not be used as
 *          the destination address of an IP packet.
 *
 *          <p> The <i>Loopback</i> Addresses -- This is the address
 *          assigned to the loopback interface. Anything sent to this
 *          IP address loops around and becomes IP input on the local
 *          host. This address is often used when testing a
 *          client.</td></tr>
 *    <tr><th valign=top><i>multicast</i></th>
 *        <td>An identifier for a set of interfaces (typically belonging
 *          to different nodes). A packet sent to a multicast address is
 *          delivered to all interfaces identified by that address.</td></tr>
 *  </table></blockquote>
 *
 *  <h4> IP address scope </h4>
 *
 *  <p> <i>Link-local</i> addresses are designed to be used for addressing
 *  on a single link for purposes such as auto-address configuration,
 *  neighbor discovery, or when no routers are present.
 *
 *  <p> <i>Site-local</i> addresses are designed to be used for addressing
 *  inside of a site without the need for a global prefix.
 *
 *  <p> <i>Global</i> addresses are unique across the internet.
 *
 *  <h4> Textual representation of IP addresses </h4>
 *
 *  The textual representation of an IP address is address family specific.
 *
 *  <p>
 *
 *  For IPv4 address format, please refer to <A
 *  HREF="Inet4Address.html#format">Inet4Address#format</A>; For IPv6
 *  address format, please refer to <A
 *  HREF="Inet6Address.html#format">Inet6Address#format</A>.
 *
 *  <P>There is a <a href="doc-files/net-properties.html#Ipv4IPv6">couple of
 *  System Properties</a> affecting how IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are used.</P>
 *
 *  <h4> Host Name Resolution </h4>
 *
 *  Host name-to-IP address <i>resolution</i> is accomplished through
 *  the use of a combination of local machine configuration information
 *  and network naming services such as the Domain Name System (DNS)
 *  and Network Information Service(NIS). The particular naming
 *  services(s) being used is by default the local machine configured
 *  one. For any host name, its corresponding IP address is returned.
 *
 *  <p> <i>Reverse name resolution</i> means that for any IP address,
 *  the host associated with the IP address is returned.
 *
 *  <p> The InetAddress class provides methods to resolve host names to
 *  their IP addresses and vice versa.
 *
 *  <h4> InetAddress Caching </h4>
 *
 *  The InetAddress class has a cache to store successful as well as
 *  unsuccessful host name resolutions.
 *
 *  <p> By default, when a security manager is installed, in order to
 *  protect against DNS spoofing attacks,
 *  the result of positive host name resolutions are
 *  cached forever. When a security manager is not installed, the default
 *  behavior is to cache entries for a finite (implementation dependent)
 *  period of time. The result of unsuccessful host
 *  name resolution is cached for a very short period of time (10
 *  seconds) to improve performance.
 *
 *  <p> If the default behavior is not desired, then a Java security property
 *  can be set to a different Time-to-live (TTL) value for positive
 *  caching. Likewise, a system admin can configure a different
 *  negative caching TTL value when needed.
 *
 *  <p> Two Java security properties control the TTL values used for
 *   positive and negative host name resolution caching:
 *
 *  <blockquote>
 *  <dl>
 *  <dt><b>networkaddress.cache.ttl</b></dt>
 *  <dd>Indicates the caching policy for successful name lookups from
 *  the name service. The value is specified as as integer to indicate
 *  the number of seconds to cache the successful lookup. The default
 *  setting is to cache for an implementation specific period of time.
 *  <p>
 *  A value of -1 indicates "cache forever".
 *  </dd>
 *  <dt><b>networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl</b> (default: 10)</dt>
 *  <dd>Indicates the caching policy for un-successful name lookups
 *  from the name service. The value is specified as as integer to
 *  indicate the number of seconds to cache the failure for
 *  un-successful lookups.
 *  <p>
 *  A value of 0 indicates "never cache".
 *  A value of -1 indicates "cache forever".
 *  </dd>
 *  </dl>
