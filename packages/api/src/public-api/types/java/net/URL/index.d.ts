/**
 * Class {@code URL} represents a Uniform Resource
 *  Locator, a pointer to a "resource" on the World
 *  Wide Web. A resource can be something as simple as a file or a
 *  directory, or it can be a reference to a more complicated object,
 *  such as a query to a database or to a search engine. More
 *  information on the types of URLs and their formats can be found at:
 *  <a href=
 *  "http://web.archive.org/web/20051219043731/http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Demo/url-primer.html">
 *  <i>Types of URL</i></a>
 *  <p>
 *  In general, a URL can be broken into several parts. Consider the
 *  following example:
 *  <blockquote><pre>
 *      http://www.example.com/docs/resource1.html
 *  </pre></blockquote>
 *  <p>
 *  The URL above indicates that the protocol to use is
 *  {@code http} (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and that the
 *  information resides on a host machine named
 *  {@code www.example.com}. The information on that host
 *  machine is named {@code /docs/resource1.html}. The exact
 *  meaning of this name on the host machine is both protocol
 *  dependent and host dependent. The information normally resides in
 *  a file, but it could be generated on the fly. This component of
 *  the URL is called the <i>path</i> component.
 *  <p>
 *  A URL can optionally specify a "port", which is the
 *  port number to which the TCP connection is made on the remote host
 *  machine. If the port is not specified, the default port for
 *  the protocol is used instead. For example, the default port for
 *  {@code http} is {@code 80}. An alternative port could be
 *  specified as:
 *  <blockquote><pre>
 *      http://www.example.com:1080/docs/resource1.html
 *  </pre></blockquote>
 *  <p>
 *  The syntax of {@code URL} is defined by  <a
 *  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2396: Uniform
 *  Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax</i></a>, amended by <a
 *  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2732: Format for
 *  Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs</i></a>. The Literal IPv6 address format
 *  also supports scope_ids. The syntax and usage of scope_ids is described
 *  <a href="Inet6Address.html#scoped">here</a>.
 *  <p>
 *  A URL may have appended to it a "fragment", also known
 *  as a "ref" or a "reference". The fragment is indicated by the sharp
 *  sign character "#" followed by more characters. For example,
 *  <blockquote><pre>
 *      http://java.sun.com/index.html#chapter1
 *  </pre></blockquote>
 *  <p>
 *  This fragment is not technically part of the URL. Rather, it
 *  indicates that after the specified resource is retrieved, the
 *  application is specifically interested in that part of the
 *  document that has the tag {@code chapter1} attached to it. The
 *  meaning of a tag is resource specific.
 *  <p>
 *  An application can also specify a "relative URL",
 *  which contains only enough information to reach the resource
 *  relative to another URL. Relative URLs are frequently used within
 *  HTML pages. For example, if the contents of the URL:
 *  <blockquote><pre>
 *      http://java.sun.com/index.html
 *  </pre></blockquote>
 *  contained within it the relative URL:
 *  <blockquote><pre>
 *      FAQ.html
 *  </pre></blockquote>
 *  it would be a shorthand for:
 *  <blockquote><pre>
 *      http://java.sun.com/FAQ.html
 *  </pre></blockquote>
 *  <p>
 *  The relative URL need not specify all the components of a URL. If
 *  the protocol, host name, or port number is missing, the value is
 *  inherited from the fully specified URL. The file component must be
 *  specified. The optional fragment is not inherited.
 *  <p>
 *  The URL class does not itself encode or decode any URL components
 *  according to the escaping mechanism defined in RFC2396. It is the
 *  responsibility of the caller to encode any fields, which need to be
 *  escaped prior to calling URL, and also to decode any escaped fields,
 *  that are returned from URL. Furthermore, because URL has no knowledge
 *  of URL escaping, it does not recognise equivalence between the encoded
 *  or decoded form of the same URL. For example, the two URLs:<br>
 *  <pre>    http://foo.com/hello world/ and http://foo.com/hello%20world</pre>
 *  would be considered not equal to each other.
 *  <p>
 *  Note, the {@link java.net.URI} class does perform escaping of its
 *  component fields in certain circumstances. The recommended way
 *  to manage the encoding and decoding of URLs is to use {@link java.net.URI},
 *  and to convert between these two classes using {@link #toURI()} and
 *  {@link URI#toURL()}.
 *  <p>
 *  The {@link URLEncoder} and {@link URLDecoder} classes can also be
 *  used, but only for HTML form encoding, which is not the same
 *  as the encoding scheme defined in RFC2396.
