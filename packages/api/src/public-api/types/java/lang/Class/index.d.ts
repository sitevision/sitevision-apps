/**
 * Instances of the class {@code Class} represent classes and
 *  interfaces in a running Java application.  An enum is a kind of
 *  class and an annotation is a kind of interface.  Every array also
 *  belongs to a class that is reflected as a {@code Class} object
 *  that is shared by all arrays with the same element type and number
 *  of dimensions.  The primitive Java types ({@code boolean},
 *  {@code byte}, {@code char}, {@code short},
 *  {@code int}, {@code long}, {@code float}, and
 *  {@code double}), and the keyword {@code void} are also
 *  represented as {@code Class} objects.
 *
 *  <p> {@code Class} has no public constructor. Instead {@code Class}
 *  objects are constructed automatically by the Java Virtual Machine as classes
 *  are loaded and by calls to the {@code defineClass} method in the class
 *  loader.
 *
 *  <p> The following example uses a {@code Class} object to print the
 *  class name of an object:
 *
 *  <blockquote><pre>
 *      void printClassName(Object obj) {
 *          System.out.println("The class of " + obj +
 *                             " is " + obj.getClass().getName());
 *      }
 *  </pre></blockquote>
 *
 *  <p> It is also possible to get the {@code Class} object for a named
 *  type (or for void) using a class literal.  See Section 15.8.2 of
 *  <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>.
 *  For example:
 *
 *  <blockquote>
 *      {@code System.out.println("The name of class Foo is: "+Foo.class.getName());}
 *  </blockquote>
 * @param <T> the type of the class modeled by this {@code Class}&#xA; object. For example, the type of {@code String.class} is {@code&#xA; Class<String>}. Use {@code Class<?>} if the class being modeled is&#xA; unknown.
