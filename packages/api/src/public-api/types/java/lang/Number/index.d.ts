/**
 * The abstract class {@code Number} is the superclass of platform
 *  classes representing numeric values that are convertible to the
 *  primitive types {@code byte}, {@code double}, {@code float}, {@code
 *  int}, {@code long}, and {@code short}.
 *
 *  The specific semantics of the conversion from the numeric value of
 *  a particular {@code Number} implementation to a given primitive
 *  type is defined by the {@code Number} implementation in question.
 *
 *  For platform classes, the conversion is often analogous to a
 *  narrowing primitive conversion or a widening primitive conversion
 *  as defining in <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite>
 *  for converting between primitive types.  Therefore, conversions may
 *  lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value, may
 *  lose precision, and may even return a result of a different sign
 *  than the input.
 *
 *  See the documentation of a given {@code Number} implementation for
 *  conversion details.
