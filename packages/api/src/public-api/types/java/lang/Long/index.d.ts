/**
 * The {@code Long} class wraps a value of the primitive type {@code
 *  long} in an object. An object of type {@code Long} contains a
 *  single field whose type is {@code long}.
 *
 *  <p> In addition, this class provides several methods for converting
 *  a {@code long} to a {@code String} and a {@code String} to a {@code
 *  long}, as well as other constants and methods useful when dealing
 *  with a {@code long}.
 *
 *  <p>Implementation note: The implementations of the "bit twiddling"
 *  methods (such as {@link #highestOneBit(long) highestOneBit} and
 *  {@link #numberOfTrailingZeros(long) numberOfTrailingZeros}) are
 *  based on material from Henry S. Warren, Jr.'s <i>Hacker's
 *  Delight</i>, (Addison Wesley, 2002).
