/**
 * A thread-safe, mutable sequence of characters.
 *  A string buffer is like a {@link String}, but can be modified. At any
 *  point in time it contains some particular sequence of characters, but
 *  the length and content of the sequence can be changed through certain
 *  method calls.
 *  <p>
 *  String buffers are safe for use by multiple threads. The methods
 *  are synchronized where necessary so that all the operations on any
 *  particular instance behave as if they occur in some serial order
 *  that is consistent with the order of the method calls made by each of
 *  the individual threads involved.
 *  <p>
 *  The principal operations on a {@code StringBuffer} are the
 *  {@code append} and {@code insert} methods, which are
 *  overloaded so as to accept data of any type. Each effectively
 *  converts a given datum to a string and then appends or inserts the
 *  characters of that string to the string buffer. The
 *  {@code append} method always adds these characters at the end
 *  of the buffer; the {@code insert} method adds the characters at
 *  a specified point.
 *  <p>
 *  For example, if {@code z} refers to a string buffer object
 *  whose current contents are {@code "start"}, then
 *  the method call {@code z.append("le")} would cause the string
 *  buffer to contain {@code "startle"}, whereas
 *  {@code z.insert(4, "le")} would alter the string buffer to
 *  contain {@code "starlet"}.
 *  <p>
 *  In general, if sb refers to an instance of a {@code StringBuffer},
 *  then {@code sb.append(x)} has the same effect as
 *  {@code sb.insert(sb.length(), x)}.
 *  <p>
 *  Whenever an operation occurs involving a source sequence (such as
 *  appending or inserting from a source sequence), this class synchronizes
 *  only on the string buffer performing the operation, not on the source.
 *  Note that while {@code StringBuffer} is designed to be safe to use
 *  concurrently from multiple threads, if the constructor or the
 *  {@code append} or {@code insert} operation is passed a source sequence
 *  that is shared across threads, the calling code must ensure
 *  that the operation has a consistent and unchanging view of the source
 *  sequence for the duration of the operation.
 *  This could be satisfied by the caller holding a lock during the
 *  operation's call, by using an immutable source sequence, or by not
 *  sharing the source sequence across threads.
 *  <p>
 *  Every string buffer has a capacity. As long as the length of the
 *  character sequence contained in the string buffer does not exceed
 *  the capacity, it is not necessary to allocate a new internal
 *  buffer array. If the internal buffer overflows, it is
 *  automatically made larger.
 *  <p>
 *  Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 *  or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be
 *  thrown.
 *  <p>
 *  As of  release JDK 5, this class has been supplemented with an equivalent
 *  class designed for use by a single thread, {@link StringBuilder}.  The
 *  {@code StringBuilder} class should generally be used in preference to
 *  this one, as it supports all of the same operations but it is faster, as
 *  it performs no synchronization.
