/**
 * {@code Package} objects contain version information
 *  about the implementation and specification of a Java package.
 *  This versioning information is retrieved and made available
 *  by the {@link ClassLoader} instance that
 *  loaded the class(es).  Typically, it is stored in the manifest that is
 *  distributed with the classes.
 *
 *  <p>The set of classes that make up the package may implement a
 *  particular specification and if so the specification title, version number,
 *  and vendor strings identify that specification.
 *  An application can ask if the package is
 *  compatible with a particular version, see the {@link
 *  #isCompatibleWith isCompatibleWith}
 *  method for details.
 *
 *  <p>Specification version numbers use a syntax that consists of nonnegative
 *  decimal integers separated by periods ".", for example "2.0" or
 *  "1.2.3.4.5.6.7".  This allows an extensible number to be used to represent
 *  major, minor, micro, etc. versions.  The version specification is described
 *  by the following formal grammar:
 *  <blockquote>
 *  <dl>
 *  <dt><i>SpecificationVersion:</i>
 *  <dd><i>Digits RefinedVersion<sub>opt</sub></i>
 *
 *  <dt><i>RefinedVersion:</i>
 *  <dd>{@code .} <i>Digits</i>
 *  <dd>{@code .} <i>Digits RefinedVersion</i>
 *
 *  <dt><i>Digits:</i>
 *  <dd><i>Digit</i>
 *  <dd><i>Digits</i>
 *
 *  <dt><i>Digit:</i>
 *  <dd>any character for which {@link Character#isDigit} returns {@code true},
 *  e.g. 0, 1, 2, ...
 *  </dl>
 *  </blockquote>
 *
 *  <p>The implementation title, version, and vendor strings identify an
 *  implementation and are made available conveniently to enable accurate
 *  reporting of the packages involved when a problem occurs. The contents
 *  all three implementation strings are vendor specific. The
 *  implementation version strings have no specified syntax and should
 *  only be compared for equality with desired version identifiers.
 *
 *  <p>Within each {@code ClassLoader} instance all classes from the same
 *  java package have the same Package object.  The static methods allow a package
 *  to be found by name or the set of all packages known to the current class
 *  loader to be found.
 * @see ClassLoader#definePackage
