/**
 * Service-provider class for file systems. The methods defined by the {@link
 *  java.nio.file.Files} class will typically delegate to an instance of this
 *  class.
 *
 *  <p> A file system provider is a concrete implementation of this class that
 *  implements the abstract methods defined by this class. A provider is
 *  identified by a {@code URI} {@link #getScheme() scheme}. The default provider
 *  is identified by the URI scheme "file". It creates the {@link FileSystem} that
 *  provides access to the file systems accessible to the Java virtual machine.
 *  The {@link FileSystems} class defines how file system providers are located
 *  and loaded. The default provider is typically a system-default provider but
 *  may be overridden if the system property {@code
 *  java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider} is set. In that case, the
 *  provider has a one argument constructor whose formal parameter type is {@code
 *  FileSystemProvider}. All other providers have a zero argument constructor
 *  that initializes the provider.
 *
 *  <p> A provider is a factory for one or more {@link FileSystem} instances. Each
 *  file system is identified by a {@code URI} where the URI's scheme matches
 *  the provider's {@link #getScheme scheme}. The default file system, for example,
 *  is identified by the URI {@code "file:///"}. A memory-based file system,
 *  for example, may be identified by a URI such as {@code "memory:///?name=logfs"}.
 *  The {@link #newFileSystem newFileSystem} method may be used to create a file
 *  system, and the {@link #getFileSystem getFileSystem} method may be used to
 *  obtain a reference to an existing file system created by the provider. Where
 *  a provider is the factory for a single file system then it is provider dependent
 *  if the file system is created when the provider is initialized, or later when
 *  the {@code newFileSystem} method is invoked. In the case of the default
 *  provider, the {@code FileSystem} is created when the provider is initialized.
 *
 *  <p> All of the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 *  threads.
 * @since 1.7
