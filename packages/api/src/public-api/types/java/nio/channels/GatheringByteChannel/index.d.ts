 *  Gathering writes are often useful when implementing network protocols or
 *  file formats that, for example, group data into segments consisting of one
 *  or more fixed-length headers followed by a variable-length body.  Similar
 *  <i>scattering</i> read operations are defined in the {@link

   * Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from a subsequence of the

   *
   *  <p> An attempt is made to write up to <i>r</i> bytes to this channel,
   *  where <i>r</i> is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified
   *  subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,
   *
   *  <blockquote><pre>
   *  srcs[offset].remaining()
   *      + srcs[offset+1].remaining()
   *      + ... + srcs[offset+length-1].remaining()</pre></blockquote>
   *
   *  at the moment that this method is invoked.
   *
   *  <p> Suppose that a byte sequence of length <i>n</i> is written, where
   *  <tt>0</tt>&nbsp;<tt>&lt;=</tt>&nbsp;<i>n</i>&nbsp;<tt>&lt;=</tt>&nbsp;<i>r</i>.
   *  Up to the first <tt>srcs[offset].remaining()</tt> bytes of this sequence
   *  are written from buffer <tt>srcs[offset]</tt>, up to the next
   *  <tt>srcs[offset+1].remaining()</tt> bytes are written from buffer
   *  <tt>srcs[offset+1]</tt>, and so forth, until the entire byte sequence is
   *  written.  As many bytes as possible are written from each buffer, hence
   *  the final position of each updated buffer, except the last updated
   *  buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to that buffer's limit.
   *
   *  <p> Unless otherwise specified, a write operation will return only after
   *  writing all of the <i>r</i> requested bytes.  Some types of channels,
   *  depending upon their state, may write only some of the bytes or possibly
   *  none at all.  A socket channel in non-blocking mode, for example, cannot
   *  write any more bytes than are free in the socket's output buffer.
   *
   *  <p> This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has
   *  already initiated a write operation upon this channel, however, then an
   *  invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
   *  complete. </p>
