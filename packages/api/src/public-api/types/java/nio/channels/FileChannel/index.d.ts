/**
 * A channel for reading, writing, mapping, and manipulating a file.
 *
 *  <p> A file channel is a {@link SeekableByteChannel} that is connected to
 *  a file. It has a current <i>position</i> within its file which can
 *  be both {@link #position() <i>queried</i>} and {@link #position(long)
 *  <i>modified</i>}.  The file itself contains a variable-length sequence
 *  of bytes that can be read and written and whose current {@link #size
 *  <i>size</i>} can be queried.  The size of the file increases
 *  when bytes are written beyond its current size; the size of the file
 *  decreases when it is {@link #truncate <i>truncated</i>}.  The
 *  file may also have some associated <i>metadata</i> such as access
 *  permissions, content type, and last-modification time; this class does not
 *  define methods for metadata access.
 *
 *  <p> In addition to the familiar read, write, and close operations of byte
 *  channels, this class defines the following file-specific operations: </p>
 *
 *  <ul>
 *
 *    <li><p> Bytes may be {@link #read(ByteBuffer, long) read} or
 *    {@link #write(ByteBuffer, long) <i>written</i>} at an absolute
 *    position in a file in a way that does not affect the channel's current
 *    position.  </p></li>
 *
 *    <li><p> A region of a file may be {@link #map <i>mapped</i>}
 *    directly into memory; for large files this is often much more efficient
 *    than invoking the usual <tt>read</tt> or <tt>write</tt> methods.
 *    </p></li>
 *
 *    <li><p> Updates made to a file may be {@link #force <i>forced
 *    out</i>} to the underlying storage device, ensuring that data are not
 *    lost in the event of a system crash.  </p></li>
 *
 *    <li><p> Bytes can be transferred from a file {@link #transferTo <i>to
 *    some other channel</i>}, and {@link #transferFrom <i>vice
 *    versa</i>}, in a way that can be optimized by many operating systems
 *    into a very fast transfer directly to or from the filesystem cache.
 *    </p></li>
 *
 *    <li><p> A region of a file may be {@link FileLock <i>locked</i>}
 *    against access by other programs.  </p></li>
 *
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p> File channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  The
 *  {@link Channel#close close} method may be invoked at any time, as specified
 *  by the {@link Channel} interface.  Only one operation that involves the
 *  channel's position or can change its file's size may be in progress at any
 *  given time; attempts to initiate a second such operation while the first is
 *  still in progress will block until the first operation completes.  Other
 *  operations, in particular those that take an explicit position, may proceed
 *  concurrently; whether they in fact do so is dependent upon the underlying
 *  implementation and is therefore unspecified.
 *
 *  <p> The view of a file provided by an instance of this class is guaranteed
 *  to be consistent with other views of the same file provided by other
 *  instances in the same program.  The view provided by an instance of this
 *  class may or may not, however, be consistent with the views seen by other
 *  concurrently-running programs due to caching performed by the underlying
 *  operating system and delays induced by network-filesystem protocols.  This
 *  is true regardless of the language in which these other programs are
 *  written, and whether they are running on the same machine or on some other
 *  machine.  The exact nature of any such inconsistencies are system-dependent
 *  and are therefore unspecified.
 *
 *  <p> A file channel is created by invoking one of the {@link #open open}
 *  methods defined by this class. A file channel can also be obtained from an
 *  existing {@link java.io.FileInputStream#getChannel FileInputStream}, {@link
 *  java.io.FileOutputStream#getChannel FileOutputStream}, or {@link
 *  java.io.RandomAccessFile#getChannel RandomAccessFile} object by invoking
 *  that object's <tt>getChannel</tt> method, which returns a file channel that
 *  is connected to the same underlying file. Where the file channel is obtained
 *  from an existing stream or random access file then the state of the file
 *  channel is intimately connected to that of the object whose <tt>getChannel</tt>
 *  method returned the channel.  Changing the channel's position, whether
 *  explicitly or by reading or writing bytes, will change the file position of
 *  the originating object, and vice versa. Changing the file's length via the
 *  file channel will change the length seen via the originating object, and vice
 *  versa.  Changing the file's content by writing bytes will change the content
 *  seen by the originating object, and vice versa.
 *
 *  <a name="open-mode"></a> <p> At various points this class specifies that an
 *  instance that is "open for reading," "open for writing," or "open for
 *  reading and writing" is required.  A channel obtained via the {@link
 *  java.io.FileInputStream#getChannel getChannel} method of a {@link
 *  java.io.FileInputStream} instance will be open for reading.  A channel
 *  obtained via the {@link java.io.FileOutputStream#getChannel getChannel}
 *  method of a {@link java.io.FileOutputStream} instance will be open for
 *  writing.  Finally, a channel obtained via the {@link
 *  java.io.RandomAccessFile#getChannel getChannel} method of a {@link
 *  java.io.RandomAccessFile} instance will be open for reading if the instance
 *  was created with mode <tt>"r"</tt> and will be open for reading and writing
 *  if the instance was created with mode <tt>"rw"</tt>.
 *
 *  <a name="append-mode"></a><p> A file channel that is open for writing may be in
 *  <i>append mode</i>, for example if it was obtained from a file-output stream
 *  that was created by invoking the {@link
 *  java.io.FileOutputStream#FileOutputStream(java.io.File,boolean)
 *  FileOutputStream(File,boolean)} constructor and passing <tt>true</tt> for
 *  the second parameter.  In this mode each invocation of a relative write
 *  operation first advances the position to the end of the file and then writes
 *  the requested data.  Whether the advancement of the position and the writing
 *  of the data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
 *  therefore unspecified.
