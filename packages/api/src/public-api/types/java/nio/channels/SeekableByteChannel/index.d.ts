/**
 * A byte channel that maintains a current <i>position</i> and allows the
 *  position to be changed.
 *
 *  <p> A seekable byte channel is connected to an entity, typically a file,
 *  that contains a variable-length sequence of bytes that can be read and
 *  written. The current position can be {@link #position() <i>queried</i>} and
 *  {@link #position(long) <i>modified</i>}. The channel also provides access to
 *  the current <i>size</i> of the entity to which the channel is connected. The
 *  size increases when bytes are written beyond its current size; the size
 *  decreases when it is {@link #truncate <i>truncated</i>}.
 *
 *  <p> The {@link #position(long) position} and {@link #truncate truncate} methods
 *  which do not otherwise have a value to return are specified to return the
 *  channel upon which they are invoked. This allows method invocations to be
 *  chained. Implementations of this interface should specialize the return type
 *  so that method invocations on the implementation class can be chained.
 * @since 1.7
 * @see java.nio.file.Files#newByteChannel
