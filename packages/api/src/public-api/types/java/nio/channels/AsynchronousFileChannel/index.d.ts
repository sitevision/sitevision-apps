/**
 * An asynchronous channel for reading, writing, and manipulating a file.
 *
 *  <p> An asynchronous file channel is created when a file is opened by invoking
 *  one of the {@link #open open} methods defined by this class. The file contains
 *  a variable-length sequence of bytes that can be read and written and whose
 *  current size can be {@link #size() queried}. The size of the file increases
 *  when bytes are written beyond its  current size; the size of the file decreases
 *  when it is {@link #truncate truncated}.
 *
 *  <p> An asynchronous file channel does not have a <i>current position</i>
 *  within the file. Instead, the file position is specified to each read and
 *  write method that initiates asynchronous operations. A {@link CompletionHandler}
 *  is specified as a parameter and is invoked to consume the result of the I/O
 *  operation. This class also defines read and write methods that initiate
 *  asynchronous operations, returning a {@link Future} to represent the pending
 *  result of the operation. The {@code Future} may be used to check if the
 *  operation has completed, wait for its completion, and retrieve the result.
 *
 *  <p> In addition to read and write operations, this class defines the
 *  following operations: </p>
 *
 *  <ul>
 *
 *    <li><p> Updates made to a file may be {@link #force <i>forced
 *    out</i>} to the underlying storage device, ensuring that data are not
 *    lost in the event of a system crash.  </p></li>
 *
 *    <li><p> A region of a file may be {@link #lock <i>locked</i>} against
 *    access by other programs.  </p></li>
 *
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p> An {@code AsynchronousFileChannel} is associated with a thread pool to
 *  which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch to completion
 *  handlers that consume the results of I/O operations on the channel. The
 *  completion handler for an I/O operation initiated on a channel is guaranteed
 *  to be invoked by one of the threads in the thread pool (This ensures that the
 *  completion handler is run by a thread with the expected <em>identity</em>).
 *  Where an I/O operation completes immediately, and the initiating thread is
 *  itself a thread in the thread pool, then the completion handler may be invoked
 *  directly by the initiating thread. When an {@code AsynchronousFileChannel} is
 *  created without specifying a thread pool then the channel is associated with
 *  a system-dependent default thread pool that may be shared with other
 *  channels. The default thread pool is configured by the system properties
 *  defined by the {@link AsynchronousChannelGroup} class.
 *
 *  <p> Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. The
 *  {@link Channel#close close} method may be invoked at any time, as specified
 *  by the {@link Channel} interface. This causes all outstanding asynchronous
 *  operations on the channel to complete with the exception {@link
 *  AsynchronousCloseException}. Multiple read and write operations may be
 *  outstanding at the same time. When multiple read and write operations are
 *  outstanding then the ordering of the I/O operations, and the order that the
 *  completion handlers are invoked, is not specified; they are not, in particular,
 *  guaranteed to execute in the order that the operations were initiated. The
 *  {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer ByteBuffers} used when reading or writing are not
 *  safe for use by multiple concurrent I/O operations. Furthermore, after an I/O
 *  operation is initiated then care should be taken to ensure that the buffer is
 *  not accessed until after the operation has completed.
 *
 *  <p> As with {@link FileChannel}, the view of a file provided by an instance of
 *  this class is guaranteed to be consistent with other views of the same file
 *  provided by other instances in the same program.  The view provided by an
 *  instance of this class may or may not, however, be consistent with the views
 *  seen by other concurrently-running programs due to caching performed by the
 *  underlying operating system and delays induced by network-filesystem protocols.
 *  This is true regardless of the language in which these other programs are
 *  written, and whether they are running on the same machine or on some other
 *  machine.  The exact nature of any such inconsistencies are system-dependent
 *  and are therefore unspecified.

     *
     *  <p> Invoking this method may cause an I/O operation to occur even if the
     *  channel was only opened for reading.  Some operating systems, for
     *  example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file's metadata, and
     *  this time is updated whenever the file is read.  Whether or not this is
     *  actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified.

     * Acquires a lock on the given region of this channel's file.
     *
     *  <p> This method initiates an operation to acquire a lock on the given
     *  region of this channel's file. The {@code handler} parameter is a
     *  completion handler that is invoked when the lock is acquired (or the
     *  operation fails). The result passed to the completion handler is the
     *  resulting {@code FileLock}.
     *
     *  <p> The region specified by the {@code position} and {@code size}
     *  parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual
     *  underlying file.  Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region
     *  initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the
     *  region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock.
     *  If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is
     *  required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the
     *  expected maximum size of the file, should be locked.  The two-argument
     *  {@link #lock(Object,CompletionHandler)} method simply locks a region
     *  of size {@link Long#MAX_VALUE}. If a lock that overlaps the requested
     *  region is already held by this Java virtual machine, or this method has
     *  been invoked to lock an overlapping region and that operation has not
     *  completed, then this method throws {@link OverlappingFileLockException}.
     *
     *  <p> Some operating systems do not support a mechanism to acquire a file
     *  lock in an asynchronous manner. Consequently an implementation may
     *  acquire the file lock in a background thread or from a task executed by
     *  a thread in the associated thread pool. If there are many lock operations
     *  outstanding then it may consume threads in the Java virtual machine for
     *  indefinite periods.
     *
     *  <p> Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a
     *  request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for
     *  an exclusive lock.  Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or
     *  exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's {@link
     *  FileLock#isShared() isShared} method.
     *
     *  <p> File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine.
     *  They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple
