/**
 * A named mapping between sequences of sixteen-bit Unicode <a
 *  href="../../lang/Character.html#unicode">code units</a> and sequences of
 *  bytes.  This class defines methods for creating decoders and encoders and
 *  for retrieving the various names associated with a charset.  Instances of
 *  this class are immutable.
 *
 *  <p> This class also defines static methods for testing whether a particular
 *  charset is supported, for locating charset instances by name, and for
 *  constructing a map that contains every charset for which support is
 *  available in the current Java virtual machine.  Support for new charsets can
 *  be added via the service-provider interface defined in the {@link
 *  java.nio.charset.spi.CharsetProvider} class.
 *
 *  <p> All of the methods defined in this class are safe for use by multiple
 *  concurrent threads.

 *  <h2>Charset names</h2>
 *
 *  <p> Charsets are named by strings composed of the following characters:
 *
 *  <ul>
 *
 *    <li> The uppercase letters <tt>'A'</tt> through <tt>'Z'</tt>
 *         (<tt>'&#92;u0041'</tt>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<tt>'&#92;u005a'</tt>),
 *
 *    <li> The lowercase letters <tt>'a'</tt> through <tt>'z'</tt>
 *         (<tt>'&#92;u0061'</tt>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<tt>'&#92;u007a'</tt>),
 *
 *    <li> The digits <tt>'0'</tt> through <tt>'9'</tt>
 *         (<tt>'&#92;u0030'</tt>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<tt>'&#92;u0039'</tt>),
 *
 *    <li> The dash character <tt>'-'</tt>
 *         (<tt>'&#92;u002d'</tt>,&nbsp;<small>HYPHEN-MINUS</small>),
 *
 *    <li> The plus character <tt>'+'</tt>
 *         (<tt>'&#92;u002b'</tt>,&nbsp;<small>PLUS SIGN</small>),
 *
 *    <li> The period character <tt>'.'</tt>
 *         (<tt>'&#92;u002e'</tt>,&nbsp;<small>FULL STOP</small>),
 *
 *    <li> The colon character <tt>':'</tt>
 *         (<tt>'&#92;u003a'</tt>,&nbsp;<small>COLON</small>), and
 *
 *    <li> The underscore character <tt>'_'</tt>
 *         (<tt>'&#92;u005f'</tt>,&nbsp;<small>LOW&nbsp;LINE</small>).
 *
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  A charset name must begin with either a letter or a digit.  The empty string
 *  is not a legal charset name.  Charset names are not case-sensitive; that is,
 *  case is always ignored when comparing charset names.  Charset names
 *  generally follow the conventions documented in <a
 *  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2278.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2278:&nbsp;IANA Charset
 *  Registration Procedures</i></a>.
 *
 *  <p> Every charset has a <i>canonical name</i> and may also have one or more
 *  <i>aliases</i>.  The canonical name is returned by the {@link #name() name} method
 *  of this class.  Canonical names are, by convention, usually in upper case.
 *  The aliases of a charset are returned by the {@link #aliases() aliases}
 *  method.
 *
 *  <p><a name="hn">Some charsets have an <i>historical name</i> that is defined for
 *  compatibility with previous versions of the Java platform.</a>  A charset's
 *  historical name is either its canonical name or one of its aliases.  The
 *  historical name is returned by the <tt>getEncoding()</tt> methods of the
 *  {@link java.io.InputStreamReader#getEncoding InputStreamReader} and {@link
 *  java.io.OutputStreamWriter#getEncoding OutputStreamWriter} classes.
 *
 *  <p><a name="iana"> </a>If a charset listed in the <a
 *  href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets"><i>IANA Charset
 *  Registry</i></a> is supported by an implementation of the Java platform then
 *  its canonical name must be the name listed in the registry. Many charsets
 *  are given more than one name in the registry, in which case the registry
 *  identifies one of the names as <i>MIME-preferred</i>.  If a charset has more
 *  than one registry name then its canonical name must be the MIME-preferred
 *  name and the other names in the registry must be valid aliases.  If a
 *  supported charset is not listed in the IANA registry then its canonical name
 *  must begin with one of the strings <tt>"X-"</tt> or <tt>"x-"</tt>.
 *
 *  <p> The IANA charset registry does change over time, and so the canonical
 *  name and the aliases of a particular charset may also change over time.  To
 *  ensure compatibility it is recommended that no alias ever be removed from a
 *  charset, and that if the canonical name of a charset is changed then its
 *  previous canonical name be made into an alias.
 *
 *
 *  <h2>Standard charsets</h2>
 *
 *
 *
 *  <p><a name="standard">Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
 *  following standard charsets.</a>  Consult the release documentation for your
 *  implementation to see if any other charsets are supported.  The behavior
 *  of such optional charsets may differ between implementations.
 *
 *  <blockquote><table width="80%" summary="Description of standard charsets">

 *
 *  <p> The <tt>UTF-8</tt> charset is specified by <a
 *  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2279.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2279</i></a>; the
 *  transformation format upon which it is based is specified in
 *  Amendment&nbsp;2 of ISO&nbsp;10646-1 and is also described in the <a
 *  href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/standard.html"><i>Unicode
 *  Standard</i></a>.
 *
 *  <p> The <tt>UTF-16</tt> charsets are specified by <a
 *  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2781.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2781</i></a>; the
 *  transformation formats upon which they are based are specified in
 *  Amendment&nbsp;1 of ISO&nbsp;10646-1 and are also described in the <a
 *  href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/standard.html"><i>Unicode
 *  Standard</i></a>.
 *
 *  <p> The <tt>UTF-16</tt> charsets use sixteen-bit quantities and are
 *  therefore sensitive to byte order.  In these encodings the byte order of a
 *  stream may be indicated by an initial <i>byte-order mark</i> represented by
 *  the Unicode character <tt>'&#92;uFEFF'</tt>.  Byte-order marks are handled
 *  as follows:
 *
 *  <ul>
 *
 *    <li><p> When decoding, the <tt>UTF-16BE</tt> and <tt>UTF-16LE</tt>
 *    charsets interpret the initial byte-order marks as a <small>ZERO-WIDTH
 *    NON-BREAKING SPACE</small>; when encoding, they do not write
 *    byte-order marks. </p></li>
 *
 *
 *    <li><p> When decoding, the <tt>UTF-16</tt> charset interprets the
 *    byte-order mark at the beginning of the input stream to indicate the
 *    byte-order of the stream but defaults to big-endian if there is no
 *    byte-order mark; when encoding, it uses big-endian byte order and writes
 *    a big-endian byte-order mark. </p></li>
 *
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  In any case, byte order marks occurring after the first element of an
 *  input sequence are not omitted since the same code is used to represent
 *  <small>ZERO-WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE</small>.
 *
 *  <p> Every instance of the Java virtual machine has a default charset, which
 *  may or may not be one of the standard charsets.  The default charset is
 *  determined during virtual-machine startup and typically depends upon the
 *  locale and charset being used by the underlying operating system. </p>
 *
 *  <p>The {@link StandardCharsets} class defines constants for each of the
 *  standard charsets.
 *
 *  <h2>Terminology</h2>
 *
 *  <p> The name of this class is taken from the terms used in
 *  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2278.txt"><i>RFC&nbsp;2278</i></a>.
 *  In that document a <i>charset</i> is defined as the combination of
 *  one or more coded character sets and a character-encoding scheme.
 *  (This definition is confusing; some other software systems define
 *  <i>charset</i> as a synonym for <i>coded character set</i>.)
 *
 *  <p> A <i>coded character set</i> is a mapping between a set of abstract
 *  characters and a set of integers.  US-ASCII, ISO&nbsp;8859-1,
 *  JIS&nbsp;X&nbsp;0201, and Unicode are examples of coded character sets.
 *
 *  <p> Some standards have defined a <i>character set</i> to be simply a
 *  set of abstract characters without an associated assigned numbering.
 *  An alphabet is an example of such a character set.  However, the subtle
 *  distinction between <i>character set</i> and <i>coded character set</i>
 *  is rarely used in practice; the former has become a short form for the
 *  latter, including in the Java API specification.
 *
 *  <p> A <i>character-encoding scheme</i> is a mapping between one or more
 *  coded character sets and a set of octet (eight-bit byte) sequences.
 *  UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO&nbsp;2022, and EUC are examples of
 *  character-encoding schemes.  Encoding schemes are often associated with
 *  a particular coded character set; UTF-8, for example, is used only to
 *  encode Unicode.  Some schemes, however, are associated with multiple
 *  coded character sets; EUC, for example, can be used to encode
 *  characters in a variety of Asian coded character sets.
 *
 *  <p> When a coded character set is used exclusively with a single
 *  character-encoding scheme then the corresponding charset is usually
 *  named for the coded character set; otherwise a charset is usually named
 *  for the encoding scheme and, possibly, the locale of the coded
 *  character sets that it supports.  Hence <tt>US-ASCII</tt> is both the
 *  name of a coded character set and of the charset that encodes it, while
 *  <tt>EUC-JP</tt> is the name of the charset that encodes the
 *  JIS&nbsp;X&nbsp;0201, JIS&nbsp;X&nbsp;0208, and JIS&nbsp;X&nbsp;0212
 *  coded character sets for the Japanese language.
 *
 *  <p> The native character encoding of the Java programming language is
 *  UTF-16.  A charset in the Java platform therefore defines a mapping
 *  between sequences of sixteen-bit UTF-16 code units (that is, sequences
 *  of chars) and sequences of bytes. </p>
