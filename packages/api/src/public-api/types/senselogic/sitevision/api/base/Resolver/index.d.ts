 * This is the base interface for all resolvers in the Sitevision Utility API.

 *  <p>
 *     A <em>resolver</em> operates on an object and extracts/transforms/calculates a value of different type.

 *  <p>
 *     <em>
 *        Note! This functional interface is conceptually equivalent (though the method names differ) with the

 *     See {@link senselogic.sitevision.api.node.NodeResolverUtil} for predefined resolvers that operates on nodes
 *     (i.e. <code>Resolver&lt;Node,?&gt;</code>).
