/**
 * This is the base interface for all filter splits in the Sitevision Utility API.
 *
 *  <p>
 *     A <em>filter split</em> is the result of a filtering operation on a <code>Collection</code> or an <code>Iterator</code>.
 *     When a filter is applied to a number of items, some of them will potentially be <em>accepted</em> by the filter and some
 *     of them will be <em>rejected</em> by the filter. This interface depicts the result of such filtering operation.
 *  </p>
 *
 *  <p>
 *     <em>Tip!</em> When working with a <code>Filter&lt;Node&gt;</code>, you would typically use
 *     {@link senselogic.sitevision.api.node.NodeIteratorUtil#split(javax.jcr.NodeIterator, Filter)}
 *     to split on an iterator and
 *     {@link senselogic.sitevision.api.node.NodeFilterUtil#split(java.util.Collection, Filter)}
 *     to split on a collection.
 *  </p>
