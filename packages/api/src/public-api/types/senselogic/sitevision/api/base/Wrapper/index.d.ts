/**
 * This is the base interface for all wrappers in the Sitevision Utility API.
 *
 *  <p>
 *     A <em>Wrapper</em> "wraps" and "encapsulates" the functionality of another class or interface in order to make it easier to use
 *     and potentially provide different behaviour than the wrapped object can provide. In general a wrapper is going to expand on what
 *     the wrapped object does.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *     All invocations for the wrapper will be delegated to the wrapped object, or executed with the wrapped object as subject/context
 *     when performing the invocation.
