 * Builds a compound comparator that allows comparison based on multiple comparators.

 *  <p>
 *     <em>How the compareTo method of a compound comparator works:</em> If comparator <em>A</em> and comparator <em>B</em> is added to this builder,
 *     then the compareTo method of <em>A</em> will be invoked first, and if equal (i.e. zero), the compareTo of <em>B</em> will be invoked.
 *  </p>
 *
 *  <p>
 *     See {@link senselogic.sitevision.api.base.Builder} for a comprehensive example of how to work with builders.
