/**
 * Builds volatile and short-lived nodes with primary node type <em>sv:temporaryFile</em>.
 *
 *  <p>
 *     The sole purpose of a <em>sv:temporaryFile</em> is to represent a <code>java.io.File</code> as <code>javax.jcr.Node</code>
 *     in order to support file-related operations in the API (e.g. {@link senselogic.sitevision.api.webresource.FileUtil}).
 *  </p>
 *
 *  <p>
 *     <strong>Important note!</strong> Temporary file nodes are very volatile and short-lived.
 *     They have no parent, nor any children.
 *     A temporary file node can never be looked up by its identifier and it should never be cached.
 *     Temporary file nodes should only be used for <em>temporary purposes</em>, typically during a single execution/render phase.
 *  </p>
 *
 *  <p>
 *     See {@link Builder} for a comprehensive example of how to work with builders.
